2024 03 07 - v24.2

This release fix several issues reported since last release and adds some
new features and improvements.  

  * Allow DATA_EXPORT_ORDER to take a filename at value to be able to
    give a custom table order. The file must contain the ordered list
    of the tables. One table per line in upper case for Oracle. Thanks
    to DataCloudGaze for the feature request.
  * Add progress bar when --oracle_speed is used to avoid waiting for
    the whole data export ends.
  * Add replacement of the BITAND function by the & operator
  * Add option -f, --format to set the output format for the reports.
    It can be html or json. Default to html. Thanks to mgole001 for the
    feature request.
  * Add automatic addition of the partition key to the primary key. Prefix
    all columns with the alias in the query to get data from Oracle.
  * Add information about MSSQL masked columns in SHOW_COLUMN.
  * Add information about columnstore and compression on MSCSQL tables with
    action SHOW_TABLE.
  * Add new configuration directive PARTITION_BY_REFERENCE to defined.

    How to export Oracle partition by reference. Possible values are none,
    duplicate or the number of hash partitions to create.
    
    Value 'none' mean no translation and export of partition by reference
    like before. Value 'duplicate' will duplicate the referenced column
    in the partitioned table and apply the same partitioning from the
    referenced table to the partitioned table. If the value is a number,
    the table will be partitioned with the HASH method using the value
    as the modulo. For example if you set it to 4 it will create 4 HASH
    partitions.
    
    Default is none to not export the partitions by reference definition.

2023 07 05 - v24.0

This major release adds support to migration of SQL Server database to
PostgreSQL. It also fixes several issues reported since past height months
and adds some new features and improvements.

  * Enable the use of ALLOW/EXCLUDE directive with SHOW_* reports and throw
    a fatal error if global filters in ALLOW/EXCLUDE are set.
  * Add replacement of DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP with pg_sleep
  * Split estimate cost details per function/procedure/and package function.
  * Add cmin, cmax, ctid to reserved keywords list.
  * Add cost for presence of ADD CONSTRAINT in PLSQL code. It needs constraint
    name stability.
  * Add CLOB_AS_BLOB configuration directive to treat CLOB as BLOB when
    exporting data. When enabled Ora2Pg will apply same behavior on CLOB
    than BLOB with BLOB_LIMIT setting. This could be useful if you have
    large CLOB data. Enabled by default. Thanks to Omar Mebarki for the patch.
  * Allow COPY and TABLE type to use the NULLIF construct. Thanks to Luke Davies
    for the patch.
  * Add new SEQUENCE_VALUES export type to export DDL to set the last values
    of sequences from current Oracle database last values like the following
    statements: ALTER SEQUENCE departments_seq START WITH 290;
    Thanks to sergey grinko for the feature request.
  * Add replacement of Oracle variable : varname into PG :'varname'.
  * Add SQL Server migration to Ora2Pg. Most of the SQL Server objects are
    supported as well as data export. Translation of the TSQL stored
    procedures to plpgsql is complicated because of the lack of statement
    separator in TSQL but as usual Ora2Pg is doing is best to do as much
    work as possible. Migration assessment is also possible with SQL Server
    database. There is some dedicated configuration directives added to
    ora2Pg.conf.
  * Add support to MySQL PARTITION BY KEY() with a translation to HASH
    partitioned table using the PK/UK definition of the table or the
    columns specified in the KEY() clause. Thanks to Shubham Dabriwala
    for the report.
  * Make EXPORT_INVALID configuration directive works with TRIGGER export.
    Until now disabled triggers were not exported, setting EXPORT_INVALID
    to 1 will force the export of disabled triggers. Thanks to chetank-yb
    for the report.
  * Add support of MySQL generated default value on update. For example:
      CREATE TABLE t1 (
        dt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
      );
    Ora2Pg will translate this syntax into a trigger on the table to force
    the value of the column on an update event.
    Thanks to heysky for the report.
  * Add translation of ST_GEOMETRY data type to PostGis geometry datatype.
  * Replace ROWNUM in target list with a "row_number() over ()" clause. Thanks
    to Rui Pereira for the report.

New configuration directives:

  * Add configuration directive ST_GEOMETRYTYPE_FUNCTION to be able to set the
    function to use to extract the geometry type from a ST_Geometry column.
    Default: ST_GeometryType, example it should be set to sde.ST_GeometryType
    for ArcSDE. Thanks to Albert88373 for the report.
  * Add four new configuration directive to be able to change or prefix the
    functions used to extract information from ST_Geometry object and values.
    - ST_SRID_FUNCTION: Oracle function to use to extract the srid from
      ST_Geometry meta information. Default: ST_SRID, for example it should be
      set to sde.st_srid for ArcSDE.
    - ST_DIMENSION_FUNCTION: Oracle function to use to extract the dimension
      from ST_Geometry meta information. Default: ST_DIMENSION, for example it
      should be set to sde.st_dimention for ArcSDE.
    - ST_ASBINARY_FUNCTION: Oracle function to used to convert an ST_Geometry
      value into WKB format. Default: ST_ASBINARY, for example it should be set
      to sde.st_asbinary for ArcSDE.
    - ST_ASTEXT_FUNCTION: Oracle function to used to convert an ST_Geometry
      value into WKT format. Default: ST_ASTEXT, for example it should be set
      to sde.st_astext for ArcSDE.
    Thanks to Albert88373 for the report.
  * Add INSERT_ON_CONFLICT configuration directive. When enabled this instruct
    Ora2Pg to add an ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING clause to all INSERT statements
    generated for this type of data export. Thanks to Clemens Rieder for the
    feature request.

Backward compatibility:

  * Change the behavior of CASE_INSENSITIVE_SEARCH to allow the use of a
    collation instead of the citext extension. To disable the feature the
    value none can be used. If the migration is not MSSQL this feature is
    disabled.
  * Remove PREFIX_PARTITION configuration directive, it is now replaced by
    the RENAME_PARTITION directive. Previous behavior was to construct the
    partition name from the table name, the partition name and the sub
    partition name if any. The problem is that we often reach the max length
    for an object name and this leads to duplicate partition name. Now, when
    RENAME_PARTITION is enabled the partition tables will be renamed
    following rules:
        <tablename>_part<pos>
    where "pos" is the partition number. For subpartition this is:
       <tablename>_part<pos>_subpart<pos>
    If this is partition/subpartition default:
        <tablename>_part_default
        <tablename>_part<pos>_subpart_default
    This change will break backward comaptibilty, if PREFIX_PARTITION is
    still set, it will simply enable RENAME_PARTITION.
  * Set START value to MINVALUE when a sequence is cycled and that the START
    value is upper that MAXVALUE. Thanks to Shane Borden for the report.

2022 10 08 - v23.2

This release fix several issues reported since past height months and
adds some new features and improvements.  

  * Add export of MySQL KEY and LINEAR KEY partitioning, translated as HASH
    partitioning.
  * Allow export of object with dollar sign is his name.
  * Add export of CHECK constraints for MySQL >= 8.0.
  * Add Functional/Expression indexes export from MYSQL.
  * Add export of MySQL virtual column. Thanks to Shubham Dabriwala for the
  * Remove scale and precision of a numeric if the scale is higher than the
    precision. PostgreSQL does not support decimal/numeric attributes where
    the scale is explicitly higher than the precision.
  * Add command line option --drop_if_exists to add statement to drop objects
    before creation if it exists. It corresponds to the DROP_IF_EXISTS
  * Add option -C | --cdc_file to be able to change the name of the default file
    used to store/read SCN per table during export. Default is TABLES_SCN.log in
    the current directory. This is the file written by the --cdc_ready option.
  * Add multiprocess to count rows in PostgreSQL tables (TEST_COUNT) using -P
    command line option.
  * Add support to PostgreSQL 14 procedure with out parameters.
  * Set default PostgreSQL database target version to 14.

New configuration directives:

  * Add configuration directive MVIEW_AS_TABLE and command line option
    --mview_as_table to set which materialized view to export as table.
    By default none. Value must be a list of materialized view name or
    regexp separated by space or comma. If the object name is a materialized
    view and the export type is TABLE, the view will be exported as a create
    table statement. If export type is COPY or INSERT, the corresponding data
    will be exported.
  * Add configuration variable FDW_IMPORT_SCHEMA to rename the schema where
    foreign tables for data migration will be created. If you use several
    instances of ora2pg for data migration through the foreign data wrapper,
    you might need to change the name of the schema for each instance.
    Default: ora2pg_fdw_import
  * Add TRANSFORM_VALUE configuration directive to apply an expression when
    retrieving data from Oracle. For example:
        TRANSFORM_VALUE   CLOB_TABLE[CHARDATA:translate("CHARDATA", chr(0), ' ')]
    to replace all Oracle char(0) in a string by a space character.
  * Add EXCLUDE_COLUMNS configuration directive. Unlike MODIFY_STRUCT
    that is used to redefine a table structure, this directive allow
    to specify a list of columns per table that must be excluded from
    the export. For example:
        EXCLUDE_COLUMNS        T1(nocol1,nocol2) T2(nocol1,nocol2)
  * Add new configuration directive EXPORT_GTT to export Oracle Global Temporary
    Table using syntax recognized by the pgtt extension. For more information see
    https://github.com/darold/pgtt Default is to not export global temporary
    table as they are not supported natively by PostgreSQL.
  * Add new configuration option NO_EXCLUDED_TABLE. By default Ora2Pg exclude
    from export some Oracle "garbage" tables that should never be part of an
    export. This behavior generates a lot of REGEXP_LIKE expressions which are
    slowing down the export when looking at tables. To disable this behavior
    enable this directive, you will have to exclude or clean up later by
    yourself the unwanted tables. The regexp used to exclude the table are
    defined in the array @EXCLUDED_TABLES in lib/Ora2Pg.pm. Note this is behavior
    is independent to the EXCLUDE configuration directive.
   
Backward compatibility:

  * Force rewrite of all invalid date starting with zero year 0000 into 1970-01-01
    when it is a default value and NULL for data. Old behavior was to only replace
    0000-00-00 date.
  * Until now there was a lot of untranslated call to TRUNC(date) because
    Ora2Pg is unable to detect that the parameter is a date or a number.
    The problem is that Oracle has TRUNC(number) too and Ora2Pg try to not
    apply the transformation if there is a doubt. In most of the migration
     have met very few TRUNC(number) so now all call to TRUNC()
    will be converted to date_trunc(). There must be false positive rewrite
    but this should be far less work than the actual situation.

Here is the full list of changes and acknowledgements:

  - Fixed PostgreSQL "relation not found error" in _dump_fdw_table(), PostgreSQL
    search_path was not being used. Thanks to James Schriever for the patch.
  - Fix year and month quoting as reserved words when they are used as aliases.
    Thanks to duursma for the report.
  - Fix conversion of to_number(substr(...)) when PG substr() return empty
    string where Oracle return NULL which make the conversion to numeric fail.
    The fix using (nullif(substr(...), )::numeric) only concern TABLE export.
    Thanks to Menelaos Perdikeas for the report.
  - Add export of MySQL KEY and LINEAR KEY partitioning, now exported as HASH
    partitioning. Thanks to Sanyam Singhal for the report.
  - Remove $ sign from characters that require object name quoting.
  - Fix export of objects with the $ sign in the name. Thanks to yano-rxa and
    duursma for the report.

    the report.
  - Fix MySQL enum data type export with regression introduced by commit 24a476.
    Thanks to Shivansh Gahlot for the report.
  - Rename ORACLE_FDW_TRANSFORM to TRANSFORM_VALUE to apply in all case an
    expression when retrieving data from Oracle. For example:
      TRANSFORM_VALUE   CLOB_TABLE[CHARDATA:translate("CHARDATA", chr(0), ' ')]
    to replace all Oracle char(0) in a string by a space character.
  - Fix add_month() translation failing with some use cases. Thanks to duursma
    for the report.

    the report.
  - Force MySQL auto increment sequence to start at 1 when value is 0.
    Thanks to Rahul Barigidad for the report.

    instead of use of real or double.
  - Add export of MySQL virtual column. Thanks to Shubham Dabriwala for the
    report.
  - Fix export of MySQL function with return clause only. Thanks to Shubham
    Dabriwala for the report.
  - Remove scale and precision of a numeric if the scale is higher than the
    precision. PostgreSQL does not support decimal/numeric attributes where
    the scale is explicitly higher than the precision. Thanks to Rahul Barigidad
    for the report.
  - Fix export of comment for views. Thanks to gh-k-murata for the report.
  - Add command line option --drop_if_exists to add statement to drop objects
    before creation if tehy exists. It corresponds to the DROP_IF_EXISTS
    configuration directive. Thanks to Yoni Sade for the feature request.
  - Add option --mview_as_table to documentation.
  - Add configuration directive MVIEW_AS_TABLE and command line option
    --mview_as_table to set which materialized view to export as table.
    By default none. Value must be a list of materialized view name or
    regexp separated by space or comma. If the object name is a materialized
    view and the export type is TABLE, the view will be exported as a create
    table statement. If export type is COPY or INSERT, the corresponding data
    will be exported.
  - Disable EXPORT_GTT when export type is not TABLE. Thanks to gh-k-murata for
    the report.
  - Fix generated external servers wrongly placed in a schema. Thanks to duursma
    for the report.
  - Add configuration variable FDW_IMPORT_SCHEMA to rename the schema where
    foreign tables for data migration will be created. If you use several
    instances of ora2pg for data migration through the foreign data wrapper,
    you might need to change the name of the schema for each instance. Default
    to ora2pg_fdw_import. Thanks to James Schriever for the feature request.

  - Fix CHECK NOT NULL only constraints that was not exported by generating
    NOT NULL constraints instead. They are exclude from the count of CHECK
    constraint as suggested by Florent Jardin but a count difference persist
    for NOT NULL constraints.
  - Fix TYPE export when SCHEMA and PRESERVE_CASE have different values. Thanks
    to Florent Jardin for the report.

  - Add new configuration option NO_EXCLUDED_TABLE.    
    By default Ora2Pg exclude from export some Oracle "garbage" tables that
    should never be part of an export. This behavior generates a lot of
    REGEXP_LIKE expressions which are slowing down the export when looking at
    tables. To disable this behavior enable this directive, you will have to
    exclude or clean up later by yourself the unwanted tables. The regexp used
    to exclude tables are defined in the array @EXCLUDED_TABLES in lib/Ora2Pg.pm
    This behavior is independent to the EXCLUDE configuration directive. Thanks

    is thrown. Thanks to Suman Michael for the report.
2022 02 10 - v23.1

This release fix several issues reported since past four months and
adds some new major features and improvements.

  * Add use of greatest/least functions from new version of Orafce when
    required to return NULL on NULL input like Oracle.
  * ALLOW and EXCLUDE configuration values can now be read from a file.
    Use -a filename or -e filename to specify the list of tables that need
    to be filtered. This is useful if you have a lot of table to filter.
  * Add possibility to use of System Change Number (SCN) for data export or
    data validation by providing a specific SCN.  It can be set at command
    line using the -S or --scn option. You can give a specific SCN or if you
    want to use the current SCN at first connection time set the value to
    'current'. To use this last case the connection user must have the role
    "SELECT ANY DICTIONARY" or "SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE", the current SCN is
    looked at the v$database view.
    Example of use:
        ora2pg -c ora2pg.conf -t COPY --scn 16605281
    This adds the following clause to the query used to retrieve data for example:
        AS OF SCN 16605281
    You can also use th --scn option to use the Oracle flashback capability by
    specifying a timestamp expression instead of a SCN. For example:
        ora2pg -c ora2pg.conf -t COPY --scn "TO_TIMESTAMP('2021-12-01 00:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS')"
    This will add the following clause to the query used to retrieve data:
        AS OF TIMESTAMP TO_TIMESTAMP('2021-12-01 00:00:00', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS')
    or for example to only retrieve yesterday's data:
        ora2pg -c ora2pg.conf -t COPY --scn "SYSDATE - 1"
  * Add json output format to migration assessment. Thanks to Ted Yu for the patch.
  * Add new TO_CHAR_NOTIMEZONE configuration directive to remove any timezone
    information into the format part of the TO_CHAR() function. Disabled by default.
    Thanks to Eric Delanoe for the report.
    Note that the new default setting breaks backward compatibility, old behavior
    was to always remove the timezone part.
  * Add new configuration directive FORCE_IDENTITY_BIGINT. Usually identity
    column must be bigint to correspond to an auto increment sequence so
    Ora2Pg always force it to be a bigint. If, for any reason you want
    Ora2Pg to respect the DATA_TYPE you have set for identity column then
    disable this directive.
  * Add command line option --lo_import. By default Ora2Pg imports Oracle BLOB
    as bytea, the destination column is created
    using the bytea data type. If you want to use large object instead of bytea,
    just add the --blob_to_lo option to the ora2pg command. It will create the
    destination column as data type Oid and will save the BLOB as a large object
    using the lo_from_bytea() function. The Oid returned by the call to
    lo_from_bytea() is inserted in the destination column instead of a bytea.
    Because of the use of the function this option can only be used with actions
    SHOW_COLUMN, TABLE and INSERT. Action COPY is not allowed.
    If you want to use COPY or have huge size BLOB ( > 1GB) than can not be
    imported using lo_from_bytea() you can add option --lo_import to the
    ora2pg command. This will allow to import data in two passes:
    1) Export data using COPY or INSERT will set the Oid destination column
       for BLOB to value 0 and save the BLOB value into a dedicated file. It
       will also create a Shell script to import the BLOB files into the
       database using psql command \lo_import and to update the table Oid
       column to the returned large object Oid. The script is named
       lo_import-TABLENAME.sh
    2) Execute all scripts lo_import-TABLENAME.sh after setting the
       environment variables PGDATABASE and optionally PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER,
       etc. if they do not correspond to the default values for libpq.
       You might also execute manually a VACUUM FULL on the table to remove
       the bloat created by the table update.
    Limitation: the table must have a primary key, it is used to set the
    WHERE clause to update the Oid column after the large object import.
    Importing BLOB using this second method (--lo_import) is very slow so it
    should be reserved to rows where the BLOB > 1GB for all other rows use
    the option --blob_to_lo. To filter the rows you can use the WHERE
    configuration directive in ora2pg.conf.
  * Add command line option --cdc_ready to use current SCN per table when
    exporting data and register them into a file named TABLES_SCN.log This
    can be used for Change Data Capture (CDC) tools.
  * Allow to export only invalid objects when EXPORT_INVALID is set to 2
  * Disable per partition data export when a WHERE clause is define on the
    partitioned table or that a global WHERE clause is defined.

Backward compatibility:

Ora2Pg used to removr any timezone information from the TO_CHAR() format
function. To recover this behavior set TO_CHAR_NOTIMEZONE to 1 in ora2pg.conf

2021 11 15 - v23.0

This release fix several issues reported since past five months and
adds some new major features and improvements.

  * Add new option --blob_to_lo that can be used to export BLOB as large
    objects. It can only be used with action SHOW_COLUMN, TABLE and INSERT.
    When used with TABLE action, the BLOB column will be translated into oid
    PostgreSQL data type. When used with the INSERT export action BLOB data
    will be store as large object in the pg_largeobjects table and the oid
    referencing this large object will be stored in the main table instead
    of a bytea.
    It is not possible to use oid with COPY because this feature use function
    lo_from_bytea() that stores the large object in the external table and
    returns the oid.
    This feature works with or without the use of oracle_fdw to import the
    data and option -J can be used to improve the speed of the INSERT import
    provide that there is a numeric unique key on the table.
    Thanks to rodiq for the feature request.
  * Add command line option -W | --where clause to set the WHERE clauses to
    apply to the Oracle query to retrieve data. It can be used multiple time.
    It will override the WHERE configuration directive if there is a global
    WHERE clause or the same table WHERE clause definition. Otherwise the
    clause will be appended.
  * Add data validation feature consisting in comparing data retrieved from a
    foreign table pointing to the source Oracle table and a local PostgreSQL
    table resulting from the data export. By default Ora2Pg will extract 10000
    rows from both side, you can change this value using DATA_VALIDATION_ROWS.
    When it is set to zero all rows of the tables will be compared.
    Data validation requires that the table has a primary key or unique index
    and that the key columns is not a LOB.
    Due to differences in sort behavior between Oracle and PostgreSQL, if the
    collation of unique key columns in PostgreSQL is not 'C', the sort order of
    is different compared to Oracle. In this case the data validation will fail.
    Ora2Pg will stop comparing two tables after 10 errors, result is dumped to
    an output file named data_validation.log.
  * Add DATA_VALIDATION_ORDERING configuration directive enabled by default.
    Order of rows between both sides are different once the data have been
    modified. In this case data must be ordered using a primary key or a
    unique index, that mean that a table without such object can not be
    compared. If the validation is done just after data import in mode single
    process and without any data modification the validation can be done on all
    tables without any ordering.
  * Add DATA_VALIDATION_ERROR to stop validating data from a table after a
    certain amount of row mismatch. Default is to stop after 10 rows
    validation errors.
  * Allow multiprocess for TEST_DATA action to validate data import. Use -P
    or PARALLEL_TABLES to set the number of parallel tables checked. Output
    is now done to a file named data_validation.log saved in the current
    directory.
  * Add replacement of UTL_RAW.CAST_TO_RAW with encode().
  * Add rewrite of XMLTYPE() with xmlparse(DOCUMENT convert_from(..., 'utf-8')).
  * Add VARCHAR_TO_TEXT configuration directive. By default VARCHAR2 without
    size constraint are tranlated into text PG data type. If you want to use
    varchar instead, disable this directive.
  * Add detection of XML function for migration assessment cost.
  * Add DBMS_RANDOM to the list of Oraclism handled by Orafce.
  * Add support to mysql_fdw foreign data wrapper to export data
    PostgreSQL tables. Thanks to Yoni Sade for the feature request.
  * Allow to transform all NUMBER(*,scale) to an other data type by a
    redefinition like NUMBER(*\,2):decimal in the DATA_TYPE configuration
    directive. Thanks to Florent Jardin for the patch.
  * Add information on how to use SSL encrypted connection to documentation.
  * Add TEST_COUNT action to just report the row count diff between Oracle and

Backward compatibility changes:

  - Add FORCE_PLSQL_ENCODING configuration directive. By default Ora2Pg
    encode all functions code to ut8, this sometime can generate double
    encoding. To change this behavior, disable this configuration directive.
    Thanks to rynerisraid and lee-jongbeom for the report.
  - Change behavior regarding RAW columns. Now RAW(16) and RAW(32) columns or
    RAW columns with "SYS_GUID()" as default value are now automatically
    translated into uuid. Data will be automatically migrated as PostgreSQL
    uuid data type provided by the "uuid-ossp" extension. To recover the old
    behavior to export data as bytea whatever is the precision, the following

2021 07 02 - v22.1

This is a maintenance release to extend the feature of data export through the
oracle_fdw PostgreSQL extension to migration that use the public schema and
do not preserve case.

There is also some other fixes:

  - Fix compile_schema() call that breaks valid function based indexes by
    adding compile_all => FALSE to DBMS_UTILITY.compile_schema().
    Thanks to Pawel Fengler for the patch.
  - Force foreign table for data export as readonly to avoid accidental
    write if import schema is not cleaned.
  - Fix data export to file not possible since last changes for oracle_fdw
    export. Thanks to Niels Jespersen for the report.

2021 06 26 - v22.0

This release fix several issues reported since past three months and
adds some new features and improvements.  I must thanks MigOps Inc who
hire me to drive Oracle to PostgreSQL migrations and to develop Ora2Pg.
It's been a long time that I was looking for such a company and it is
an amazing gift for the 20 years of Ora2Pg. All improvements and new
new features developed during my work at MigOps will be available in
the public GitHub repository, here are the new ones.

  - Add export of data using oracle_fdw when FDW_SERVER is set and export
    type is COPY or INSERT. Multi-process using -P or -J is fully supported
    but option -j is useless in this case. Boolean transformation of some
    columns or data type is also supported. Actually, expect that it works
    just like data migration without oracle_fdw. This can improve the data
    migration speed from 30 to 40% especially for BLOB export.
 
  - Improve export performances with huge number of objects by avoiding join
    between Oracle catalog tables.

  - Set a maximum of assessment score for tables, indexes, sequences,
    partitions, global temporary table and synonym following the number of
    objects.

  - Add detection of XML functions to the assessment cost.

  - Allow to change the assessment cost unit value in the export_all.sh script
    when ora2pg is used with options --init_project and --cost_unit_value.

  - Remove pragma restrict_references from P/PSQL code, it is useless.

  - Add the oracle schema to search_path in SQL files generated and improve
    the migration assessment when USE_ORAFCE is enabled.

  - Apply ALLOW and EXCLUDED filtered stored procedures at package extraction
    level. Previous this patch there was no way to not export some package
    functions or to exclude them from assessment.

  - Add new tests to check sequences last values and number of identity columns
    in both side.

  - Apply ALLOW/EXCLUDE without object to table object by default in TEST
    action.

New configuration directives:

  - Add ORACLE_FDW_TRANSFORM configuration directive to apply a transformation
    to a column when exporting data. Value must be a semicolon separated list of
        TABLE[COLUMN_NAME, <replace code in SELECT target list>]
    For example to replace string 'Oracle' by 'PostgreSQL' in a varchar2 column
    use the following.
        ERROR_LOG[DBMS_TYPE:regexp_replace("DBMS_TYPE",'Oracle','PostgreSQL')]
    Thanks to MigOps for the patch.

  - Add DROP_IF_EXISTS configuration directive to add a statement
    "DROP <OBJECT> IF EXISTS" before creating the object. Can be
    useful in an iterative work. Default is disabled. Thanks to
    dherzhau for the feature request.

Backward compatibility:

    There is a backward compatibility issue with old configuration files
    where FDW_SERVER is set by default. This directive was not used when
    exporting data, this is not the case anymore as it instruct Ora2Pg to
    use the given foreign server to use oracle_fdw to migrate the data.

Here is the full list of changes and acknowledgements:

  - Fix replacement of TO_CLOB() function, now it is just removed and the
    parenthesis are kept. Thanks to Rui Pereira for the report.
  - Fix incorrect detection of cursor on dynamic query. Thanks to Rui
    Pereira for the report.
  - Fix quoting column names with spaces and dots. Dots are replaced by
    underscore. Thanks to Veka for the report.
  - Fix one case where DEFINED_PKEY with PRESERVE_CASE was not handled
    correctly. Thanks to Veka for the report.
  - Fix quoting of reserved keywords in CREATE INDEX columns names. Thanks
    to Veka for the report.
  - Fix column name starting with number not quoted in COMMENT. Thanks to
    Veka for the report.

    the package name. Thanks to Rui Pereira fo the report.
  - Fix search of ora2pg_conf.dist under Windows instead of ora2pg.conf.dist
    when --init_project is used. Thanks to Julien Monticolo for the report.
  - Fix translation from file of check constraint when created on same column,
    only the last one was exported. Also shortened the prefix for constraint
    naming, ora2pg_ckey becomes o2pc, ora2pg_ukey is now o2pu and ora2pg_fkey
    is renamed into o2pf. Thanks to anvithaprabhu8 for the report.
  - Replace wildcard precision * for numeric by 38.
  - Fix incomplete listagg() conversion. Thanks to avandras for the report.
  - Fix potential problem in last_day conversion when USE_ORAFCE is off and
    a number is added or subtracted to the last day. Thanks to atlterry for
    the report.
  - Do not apply utf8 conversion of comments to input files.
  - Fix termination of last writer process when parallel and quiet mode are
    used together. Thanks to David Harper for the patch.
  - Remove precision in number of digit in timestamp microseconds when
    setting NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT at session startup. Now use:
      ALTER SESSION SET NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF'
    instead of '.FF6'. This was possibly the cause of sporadic error:
      ORA-03106: fatal two-task communication protocol error (DBD ERROR: OCIStmtFetch)
    Default is precision 6 so it may not change anything. Thanks to
    Abhijeet Bonde for the report.

    file as a comment: -- Unsupported partition type, please check

2021 04 01 - v21.1

This release fix several issues reported since past six months and
as usual adds some new features and improvements.

    makes the translation optional to USE_ORAFCE directive.
  * Add set application name in connection to Oracle/MySql/PostgreSQL.
  * Add translation of REGEXP_COUNT() and change assessment cost.

Backward compatibility changes:

  - Force a column to be bigint if this is an identity column. Thanks
    to MigOps.com for the patch.
  - Fix EMPTY_LOB_NULL, enable/disable was inverted, keeping default
    to enabled. Take care that in old ora2pg.conf it is disabled so it

    with ENABLE_BLOB_EXPORT to avoid confusion with double negative
    variable. Backward compatibility is preserved with a warning.

2020 10 12 - v21.0

This release fix several issues reported since last release and adds
several new features and improvements.

  * Add clause OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE to INSERT statements when the
    table has an IDENTITY column.
  * Considerably increase the speed to generate the report about the
    migration assessment, especially for database with huge number of
    objects.
  * Reduce time passed in the progress bar. Following the number of
    database objects we were spending too much time in refreshing the
    progress bar.
  * Add number of identity columns in migration assessment report.
  * Make assessment details report initially hidden using HTML5 tags
    <details><summary>
  * Improve speed of BLOB/CLOB data export. Oracle recommends reading
    from and writing to a LOB in batches using a multiple of the LOB
    chunk size. This chunk size defaults to 8k (8192). Recent tests
    show that the best performances can be reach with higher value
    like 512K or 4Mb.
  * Add progress bar when --oracle_speed is use in single process mode.
  * Automatically activate USER_GRANTS when the connection user has no DBA
    privilege. A warning is displayed.
  * Complete port to Windows by using the Windows separator on stdout
    redirection into a file at ora2pg command line call and improve
    ora2pg_scanner port on Windows OS.
  * Add rewrite of MySQL JOIN with WHERE clause instead of ON.
  * Add MGDSYS (Oracle E-Business Suite) and APEX_040000 to the list
    of schemas excluded from the export.
  * Supply credentials interactively when a password is not defined in
    the configuration file. Need the installation of a new Perl module
    Term::ReadKey.
  * Add supports oracle connections "as sysdba" with username "/" and
    an empty password to connect to a local oracle instance.
  * Add translation of PRIVATE TEMPORARY TABLE from Oracle 18c into
    PostgreSQL basic temporary table, only the default behavior for
    on commit change.

New command line options:

  * Add new command line option to ora2pg_scanner: -b | --binpath DIR
    to set the full path to directory where the ora2pg binary stays.
    Might be useful only on Windows OS.
  * Add -r | --relative command line option and PSQL_RELATIVE_PATH
    configuration directive. By default Ora2Pg use \i psql command to
    execute generated SQL files if you want to use a relative path
    following the script execution file enabling this option will use
    \ir. See psql help for more information.

New configuration directives:

  * NO_VIEW_ORDERING:
      By default Ora2Pg try to order views to avoid error at import time
      with nested views. With a huge number of views this can take a very
      long time, you can bypass this ordering by enabling this directive.
  * NO_FUNCTION_METADATA
      Force Ora2Pg to not look for function declaration. Note that this
      will prevent Ora2Pg to rewrite function replacement call if needed.
      Do not enable it unless looking forward at function breaks other
      export.
  * LOB_CHUNK_SIZE
      See explanation in the new features and improvement list.
  * ALTERNATIVE_QUOTING_REGEXP
      To support the Alternative Quoting Mechanism ('Q' or 'q') for String
      Literals set the regexp with the text capture to use to extract the
      text part. For example with a variable declared as
            c_sample VARCHAR2(100 CHAR) := q'{This doesn't work.}';
      the regexp to use must be:
            ALTERNATIVE_QUOTING_REGEXP     q'{(.*)}'
      ora2pg will use the $$ delimiter, with the example the result will
      be:
            c_sample varchar(100) := $$This doesn't work.$$;
      The value of this configuration directive can be a list of regexp
      separated by a semi colon. The capture part (between parenthesis) is
      mandatory in each regexp if you want to restore the string constant.

Backward compatibility changes:

  - Default for NO_LOB_LOCATOR is now 1 to benefit from the LOB_CHUNK_SIZE
    performances gain.
  - Enable schema compilation (COMPILE_SCHEMA set to 1) by default to
    speed up DDL extraction.
  - Change the behavior of Ora2Pg with the parameters that follows a
    parameter with a default value. Ora2Pg used to change the order of the
    parameter's function to put all parameters with a default value at end
    of the list which need a function call rewrite. This have been abandoned
    now any parameter without default value after a parameter with a default
    value will be appended DEFAULT NULL.

    appears when LOB chunk size is different from default 8192. The error
    has no incidence on the export so we can just ignore it. This patch
    also use DBD::Oracle ora_lob_chunk_size() method to gather chunk the
    chunk size of the LOB, fallback to 8192 if not available. Thanks to
    joedbadmin for the report.

2019 01 18 - v20.0

This release fix several issues reported during the last three months
and adds several new features and improvement. The change of major
version is related to backward compatibility break with the removed of
most PG_SUPPORTS_* configuration directives and their replacement with
the new PG_VERSION directive.

New features and configuration directives in this release:

  * Add PG_VERSION configuration directive to set the PostgreSQL major
    version number of the target database. Ex: 9.6 or 10. Default is
    current major version at time of a new release. This replace the
    old PG_SUPPORTS_* configuration directives.
  * Removed all PG_SUPPORTS_* configuration directives minus
    PG_SUPPORTS_SUBSTR that is related to Redshift engine.
  * Export of BFILE as bytea is now done through a PL/SQL function to
    extract the content of a BFILE and generate a bytea data suitable
    for insert or copy into PostgreSQL.
  * Foreign keys that reference a partitioned table are no more
    exported.
  * Show table name on Oracle side during export using at connection
    time: DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_ACTION(table_name);
  * When the date format is ISO and the value is a constant the call
    to to_date() is removed and only the constant is preserved. For
    example: to_date(' 2013-04-01 00:00:00','SYYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS')
    is replaced by a simple call to: ' 2013-04-01 00:00:00'.
    This rewrite is limited to PARTITION export type when directive
    PG_SUPPORTS_PARTITION is enabled.
  * Add DATA_EXPORT_ORDER configuration directive. By default data
    export order will be done by sorting on table name. If you have
    huge tables at end of alphabetic order and are using multiprocess,
    it can be better to set the sort order on size so that multiple
    small tables can be processed before the largest tables finish.
    In this case set this directive to size. Possible values are name
    and size. Note that export type SHOW_TABLE and SHOW_COLUMN will
    use this sort order too, not only COPY or INSERT export type.
  * Add NO_BLOB_EXPORT configuration directive. Exporting BLOB could
    take time and you may want to export all data except the BLOB
    columns. In this case enable this directive and the BLOB columns
    will not be included into data export. The BLOB column must not
    have a NOT NULL constraint. Thanks to Ilya Vladimirovich for the
  * Add PREFIX_SUB_PARTITION to enable/disable sub-partitioning table
    prefixing in case of the partition names are a part of the sub-
    partition names.
  * Add special replacement for case of epoch syntax in Oracle:
        (sysdate - to_date('01-Jan-1970', 'dd-Mon-yyyy'))*24*60*60
    is replaced by the PostgreSQL equivalent:
        (extract(epoch from now()))

Here is the full list of changes and acknowledgements:

  - Export indexes and constraints on partitioned table with pg >= 11.
  - Fix incorrect replacement of NLS_SORT in indexes.
  - Bring back DISABLE_UNLOGGED feature. Thanks to Jean-Christophe
    Arnu for the patch
  - Fix CREATE SCHEMA statement that was not written to dump file.
  - Fix DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.set_action() call, old Oracle version
    do not support named parameters.
  - Fix duplicate index name on partition. Thanks to buragaddapavan
    for the report.
  - Add support to new configuration directive PG_VERSION to control
    the behavior of Ora2Pg following PostgreSQL version.
  - Fix error in creation of default partition with PostgreSQL 10.
    Thanks to buragaddapavan for the report.
  - Fix missing export of single MAXVALUE partition, this will produce
    the following range partition: ... FOR VALUES FROM (MINVALUE) TO
    (MAXVALUE) Previous behavior was to not export partition as it is
    better to not partition the table at all. However it is declared
    in Oracle so it is better to export it to see what can be done.
    Thanks to buragaddapavan for the report.
  - Do not export foreign keys that reference a partitioned table.
    Remove NOT VALID on foreign keys defined on a partitioned
    table if present. Thanks to Denis Oleynikov for the report.
  - Fix export of BFILE as bytea. Ora2Pg now use a PL/SQL function to
    extract the content of a BFILE and generate a bytea data suitable
    for insert or copy into PostgreSQL. Thanks to RickyTR for the
    report.
  - Add TIMEZONE_REGION and TIMEZONE_ABBR to migration assessment, no
    direct equivalent in PostgreSQL. Remove NSLSORT not used in
    migration assessment. Thanks to buragaddapavan for the report.
  - Fix output of multiple export type specified in TYPE directive.
  - Rewrite and renaming of _get_sql_data() function into
    _get_sql_statements().
  - Limit CURSOR weight in migration assessment to REF CURSOR only,
    other case are all covered. REF CURSOR might need a review to see
    if they need to be replaced with a SET OF RECORD.
  - Fix replacement of EMPTY_CLOB() or EMPTY_BLOB() with empty string
    when EMPTY_LOB_NULL is disabled and NULL when it is enabled.
  - Prefix output file with the export type in multiple export type
    mode, ex: sequence_output.sql or table_output.sql. Thanks to
    buragaddapavan for the report.
  - Fix export of data from an Oracle nested table. Thanks to rejo
    oommen for the report.
  - Removed cast to timestamp from partition range. Thanks to
    buragaddapavan and rejo-oommen for the report.
  - Fix partition default syntax. Thanks to rejo-oommen for the
    report.

    listing. Thanks to rejo-oommen for the report.
  - Add warning about parameter order change in output file.
  - Show table name on Oracle side during export using at connection
    time: DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_ACTION(table_name);
    Thanks to Denis Oleynikov for the feature request.
  - Report change in ORA_RESERVED_WORDS into documentation.
  - Add references in the keyword list of ORA_RESERVED_WORDS.
  - Fix the missing white space in some lines while creating
    import_all.sh file. Thanks to Fabiano for the patch.
  - Fix translation of infinity value for float. Thanks to Damien
    Trecu for the report.
  - Fix default value in timestamp column definition when a timezone
    is given. Thanks to buragaddapavan for the report.
  - Fix missing export of index and constraint in a partitioned
    table when DISABLE_PARTITION is enabled. Thanks to Denis Oleynikov
    for the report.
  - Prevent PARTITION BY when DISABLE_PARTITION is enabled. Thanks to
    Denis Oleynikov for the report.
  - Add DATA_EXPORT_ORDER configuration directive. By default data
    export order will be done by sorting on table name. If you have
    huge tables at end of alphabetic order and are using multiprocess,
    it can be better to set the sort order on size so that multiple
    small tables can be processed before the largest tables finish.
    In this case set this directive to size. Possible values are name
    and size. Note that export type SHOW_TABLE and SHOW_COLUMN will
    use this sort order too, not only COPY or INSERT export type.
    Thanks to Guy Browne for the feature request.
  - Fix remove leading ':' on Oracle variable taking care of regex
    character class. Thanks to jselbach for the report.
  - Add NO_BLOB_EXPORT configuration directive. Exporting BLOB could
    take time and you may want to export all data except the BLOB
    columns. In this case enable this directive and the BLOB columns
    will not be included into data export. The BLOB column must not
    have a NOT NULL constraint. Thanks to Ilya Vladimirovich for the
    feature request.
  - Fix incorrect rewrote of the first custom type in a row. Thanks
    to Francesco Loreti for the patch.
  - Remove double quote in type definition en set type name in lower
    case when PRESERVE_CASE is disabled.

    prefixing in case of the partition names are a part of the sub-
    partition names.
  - Fix epoch replacement case in CREATE TABLE statements.
  - Apply epoch replacement to default value in table declaration.
  - Add special replacement for case of epoch syntax in Oracle:
        (sysdate - to_date('01-Jan-1970', 'dd-Mon-yyyy'))*24*60*60
    is replaced by the PostgreSQL equivalent:
        (extract(epoch from now()))
    Thanks to rejo-oommen for the feature request.
  - A few typos in --help sections. Thanks to Christophe Courtois
    for the report.
  - Fix export of primary key on partition table. Thanks to chmanu
    for the patch.
  - Fix malformed user defined type export. Thanks to Francesco Loreti
    for the report.


2018 09 27 - v19.1

This release fix several issues reported during the last month and
add support to PostgreSQL 11 HASH partitioning.

It also adds some new features and configuration directives:

  * Add export of default partition and default sub partition. 
  * Add export of HASH partition type.
  * Add support of stored procedure object.
  * Add replacement of NLSORT in indexes or queries. For example:
        CREATE INDEX test_idx ON emp
                          (NLSSORT(emp_name, 'NLS_SORT=GERMAN'));
    is translated into
        CREATE INDEX test_idx ON emp
                    ((emp_name collate "german"));
    The collation still need to be adapted, here probably "de_DE".
    NLSSORT() in ORDER BY clause are also translated.
  * Prevent duplicate index with primary key on partition to be
    exported.
  * PostgreSQL native partitioning does not allow direct import of
    data into already attached partitions. We now force direct import
    into main table but we keep Oracle export of data from individual

This release also adds two new command line options:

   --oracle_speed: use to know at which speed Oracle is able to send
                   data. No data will be processed or written
   --ora2pg_speed: use to know at which speed Ora2Pg is able to send
                   transformed data. Nothing will be written

Use it for debugging purpose. They are useful to see Oracle speed to
send data and at what speed Ora2Pg is processing the data without
reaching disk or direct import into PostgreSQL. 

Two new configuration directive has been added:

  * PG_SUPPORTS_PROCEDURE : PostgreSQL v11 adds support to stored
    procedure objects. Disabled by default.
  - PARALLEL_MIN_ROWS: set the minimum number of tuples in a table
    before calling Oracle's parallel mode during data export. 
    Default to 100000 rows.

Note that PG_SUPPORTS_PARTITION and PG_SUPPORTS_IDENTITY are now
enabled by default to use PostgreSQL declarative partionning and
identity column instead of serial data type.

Here is the full list of changes and acknowledgements:

  - Fix automatic quoting of table or partition name starting with
    a number. Thanks to Barzaqh for the report.
  - Add information about custom directory installation. Thanks to
    joguess for the report.
  - Update list of action in documentation.
  - Fix export of spatial geometries. Thanks to burak yurdakul for
    the report.
  - Fix translation of default value in CREATE TABLE DDL when using
    a function. Thanks to Denis Oleynikov for the report.
  - Prevent moving index on partition during tablespace export.
    Thanks to Maxim Zakharov for the report.
  - Fix upper case of partition name in triggers.
  - Enforce KEEP_PKEY_NAMES when USE_TABLESPACE is enabled. Thanks
    to Maxim Zakharov for the patch.
  - Fix parsing of Oracle user login in dblink input from a file.
  - Fix multiple duplication of range clause in partition export.
  - Add bench of total time and rows to migrate data from Oracle
    in debug mode with speed average.
  - Fix sub partition prefix name.
  - Fix unset oracle username when exporting DBLINK from database.
    Thanks to Denis Oleynikov for the report.
  - Remove NO VALID to foreign keys on partitioned table. Thanks to
    Denis Oleynikov for the report.
  - Fix crash of Ora2Pg on regexp with dynamic pattern base on package
    code. Thank to Alain Debie and MikeCaliffCBORD for the report.
  - PostgreSQL native partitioning does not allow direct import of
    data into already attached partitions. When PG_SUPPORTS_PARTITION
    is enable we now force direct import into main single table but
    we keep Oracle export of data from individual partition. Previous
    behavior was to use main table from both side. Thanks to Denis
    Oleynikov for the report.
  - Add the PARALLEL_MIN_ROWS configuration directive to prevent
    Oracle's parallel mode to be activated during data export if the
    table have less than a certain amount of rows. Default is 100000
    rows. This prevent unnecessary fork of Oracle process. Thanks to
    Denis Oleynikov for the feature request.
  - Fix composite partition MODULUS value. Thanks to Denis Oleynikov
    for the report.
  - Fix count of partitions that was not including subpartition count.
  - Force PostgreSQL user in FDW user mapping to be PG_USER when it is
    defined.
  - Sometimes Oracle indexes can be defined as follow:
        CREATE INDEX idx_err_status_id
                                   ON err_status (status_id, 1);
    which generate errors on PostgreSQL. Remove column names composed
    of digit only from the translation. Thanks to Denis Oleynikov for
    the report.
  - Move Oracle indexes or PK defined on partitioned tables to each
    partition as PostgreSQL do not support UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY,
    EXCLUDE, or FOREIGN KEY constraints on partitioned tables.
    Definition are created in file PARTITION_INDEXES_output.sql
    generated with the PARTITION export type. Thanks to Denis
    Oleynikov for the feature request.
  - Fix parallel data load from Oracle partitioned tables by using
    a unique alias. Thanks to Denis Oleynikov for the report.
  - Fix export of composite partitioned (range/hash) table when
    PG_SUPPORTS_PARTITION is disabled. Thanks to Denis Oleynikov
    for the report.
  - Remove composite sub partition from the list of partition, this
    return a wrong partition count.
  - Fix MODULUS value in hash sub partitioning.
  - Index and table partitions could be on separate tablespaces.
    Thanks to Maxim Zakharov for the patch.
  - Fix case where procedure object name is wrongly double quoted.
    Thanks to danghb for the report.
  - Fix parser to support comment between procedure|function name
    and IS|AS keyword. Thanks to danghb for the report.
  - Remove dependency to List::Util for the min() function.


2018 08 18 - v19.0

This major release fix several issues reported by users during last
year. It also adds several new features and configuration directives.

New features:

  - Add export of Oracle HASH partitioning when PG_SUPPORTS_PARTITION
    is enabled. This is a PostgreSQL 11 feature.
  - Add SUBTYPE translation into DOMAIN with TYPE and PACKAGE export.
  - Add automatic translation of
      KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST|LAST ORDER BY ...) OVER (PARTITION BY ...)
    into
      FIRST|LAST_VALUE(...) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...).
   - Add PCTFREE to FILLFACTOR conversion when PCTFREE is upper than
     the default value: 10. 
  - Replace DELETE clause not followed with FROM (optional in Oracle).
  - Remove Oracle extra clauses in TRUNCATE command.
  - Allow use of NUMBER(*) in DATA_TYPE directive to convert all
    NUMBER(*) into the given type whatever is the length. Ex:
        DATA_TYPE    NUMBER(*):bigint.
  - Add a PARALLEL hint to all Oracle queries used to migrate data.
  - Add export of Identity Columns from Oracle Database 12c.
  - Add translation of UROWID datatype and information in documentation
    about why default corresponding type OID will fail at data import.
  - Remove unwanted and unused keywords from CREATE TABLE statements:
    PARALLEL and COMPRESS.
  - Remove TEMPORARY in DROP statements.
  - Improve speed of escape_copy() function used for data export.
  - Add translation of Oracle functions NUMTOYMINTERVAL() and
    NUMTODSINTERVAL().
  - Add counting of jobs defined in Oracle scheduler in the migration
    assessment feature. 
  - Add CSMIG in the list of Oracle default system schema
  - Fully rewrite data export for table with nested user defined types
    DBD::Oracle fetchall_arrayref() is not able to associate complex
    custom types to the returned arrays, changed this call to use
    fetchrow_array() also used to export BLOB.
  - QUERY export will now output translated queries as well as
    untranslated ones. This break backward compatibility, previously
    only translated query was dumped.
  - Auto detect UTF-8 input files to automatically use utf8 encoding.
  - Support translation of MySQL global variables.
  - Add translation of preprocessor in Oracle external table into
    program in foreign table definition. Allow translation of external
    table from file.
  - Add translation to NVL2() Oracle function.
  - Translate CONVERT() MySQL function.
  - Translate some form of GROUP_CONCAT() that was not translated.
  - Remove call to CHARSET in cast() function, replace it by COLLATE
    every where else. This must cover most of the cases but some
    specials use might not, so please reports any issue with this
    behavior.
  - Add -c | --config command line option to ora2pg_scanner to set
    custom configuration file to be used instead of ora2pg default:
    /etc/ora2pg/ora2pg.conf
  - Improve CONNECT BY and OUTER JOIN translation.
  - And lot of MySQL to PostgreSQL improvements.

Several new configuration directives have been added:

  - Add DEFAULT_PARALLELISM_DEGREE to control PARALLEL hint use
    when exporting data from Oracle. Default is disabled.
  - Make documentation about KEEP_PKEY_NAMES more explicit about
    kind of constraints affected by this directive.
  - Add PG_SUPPORTS_IDENTITY configuration directive to enable
    export of Oracle identity columns into PostgreSQL 10 feature.
    If PG_SUPPORTS_IDENTITY is disabled and there is IDENTITY column
    in the Oracle table, they are exported as serial or bigserial
    columns. When it is enabled they are exported as IDENTITY columns
    like:
    
          CREATE TABLE identity_test_tab (
                  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
                  description varchar(30)
          ) ;
    
    If there is non default sequence option set in Oracle, they will
    be appended after the IDENTITY keyword. Additionally in both cases
    Ora2Pg will create a file AUTOINCREMENT_output.sql with a function
    to update the associated sequences with the restart value set to 
    "SELECT max(colname)+1 FROM tablename". Of course this file must
    be imported after data import otherwise sequence will be kept to
    start value.
  - Add DISABLE_UNLOGGED configuration directive. By default Ora2Pg
    export Oracle tables with the NOLOGGING attribute into UNLOGGED
    tables. You may want to fully disable this feature because you
    will lost all data from unlogged table in case of PostgreSQL crash.
    Set it to 1 to export all tables as normal table. When creating a
    new migration project using --init_project, this directive is
    activated by default. This is not the case in the default
    configuration file for backward compatibility.
  - Add FORCE_SECURITY_INVOKER configuration directive. Ora2Pg use
    the function's security privileges set in Oracle and it is often
    defined as SECURITY DEFINER. To override those security privileges
    for all functions and use SECURITY DEFINER instead, enable this
    directive.
  - Add AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION in configuration to enable translation
    of autonomous transactions into a wrapper function using dblink
    or pg_background extension. If you don't want to use this feature
    and just want to export the function as a normal one without the
    pragma call, disable this directive.
  - Add documentation about COMMENT_SAVEPOINT configuration directive.
  - Major rewrite in PACKAGE parser to better support global variables
    detection. Global variable that have no default values are now
    always initialized to empty string in file global_variables.conf
    so that we see that they exists. This might not change the global
    behavior.

I especially want to thank Pavel Stehule and Eric Delanoe who spent
lot of time this year to help me to improve the PL/SQL to plpgsql
translation and also Krasiyan Andreev who help a lot to finalize
the MySQL to PostgreSQL migration features.

Here is a complete list of changes and acknowledgments:

  - Fix translation of "varname cursor%ROWTYPE;". Thanks to Philippe
    Beaudoin for the report.
  - Fix return of autonomous transaction dblink call when function has
    OUT parameter. Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Add Oracle to PostgreSQL translation of windows functions 
    KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST|LAST ORDER BY ...) OVER (PARTITION BY ...)
    Thanks to Swapnil bhoot929 for the feature request.
  - Fix "ORA-03113: end-of-file on communication channel" that what
    generated by a too long query send to Oracle. The size of queries
    sent to Oracle to retrieve object information depend of the ALLOW
    and EXCLUDE directives. If you have lot of objects to filter you
    can experience this kind of non explicit error. Now Ora2pg use
    bind parameter to pass the filters values to reduce the size of
    the prepared query. Thanks to Stephane Tachoire for the report.
  - Add SUBTYPE translation into DOMAIN with TYPE and PACKAGE export.

    fetchrow_array() also used to export BLOB. Thanks to lupynos for
    the report.
  - Fix renaming of temporary files during partitions data export.
  - Fix Oracle use of empty string as default value for integers.

    Thanks to Krasiyan Andreev for the report.
  - Fix :new and :old translation in triggers.
  - Fully rewrite function call qualification process, the second pass
    now is only use to requalify call to pkg.fct into pkg_ftc when
    PACKAGE_AS_SCHEMA is disable. The replacement of all function
    calls using double quote when a non supported character is used or
    when PRESERVE_CASE is enabled has been completely removed as this
    takes too much time to process for just very few case. So by
    default now Ora2Pg will not go through the second pass. This can
    change in the future especially if this is more performant to
    process PERFORM replacement. Thanks a lot to Eric Delanoe for his
    help on this part.

    Krasiyan Andreev for the report.
  - Support translation of MySQL global variables. Session variable
    @@varname are translated to PostgreSQL GUC variable and global
    variable @varname are translated to local variable defined in a
    DECLARE section. Ora2Pg tries to gather the data type by using
    integer by default, varchar if there is a constant string ('...')
    in the value and a timestamp if the variable name have the keyword
    date or time inside. Thanks to Krasiyan Andreev for the feature
    request.
  - Fix DATE_ADD() translation.

    for the report.
  - Translate some form of GROUP_CONCAT() that was not translated.
    Thanks to Krasiyan Andreev for the report.
  - Apply same principe with COMMIT in MySQL function code than in
    Oracle code. It is kept untouched to be able to detect a possible
    change of code logic. It can be automatically commented if
    COMMENT_COMMIT_ROLLBACK is enabled. Also I have kept the START
    TRANSACTION call but it is automatically commented.
  - Add mysql_enable_utf8 => 1 to MySQL connection to avoid issues
    with encoding. Thanks to Krasiyan Andreev for the report.

    or procedure definition in VIEW export and there is no package
    with MySQL. Thanks to Krasiyan Andreev for the report.
  - Fix call to useless function for MySQL function.
  - Add rewrite of MySQL function call in function or procedure code
    translation and some other translation related to MySQL code.

2017 09 01 - v18.2

This release fix several issues reported during the last six months.
It also adds several new features and configuration directives:

  - Add translation of SUBSTRB into substr.
  - Allow use of array in MODIFY_TYPE to export Oracle user defined
    type that are just array of some data type. For example:
      CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE mem_type IS VARRAY(10) of VARCHAR2(15);
    can be directly translated into text[] or varchar[]. In this case
    use the directive as follow: MODIFY_TYPE	CLUB:MEMBERS:text[]
    Ora2Pg will take care to transform all data of this column into
    the correct format. Only arrays of characters and numerics types
    are supported.
  - Add translation of Oracle function LISTAGG() into string_agg().
  - Add TEST_VIEW action to perform a simple count of rows returned by
    views on both database.
  - Translate SQL%ROWCOUNT into GET DIAGNOSTICS rowcount = ROW_COUNT
    and add translation of SQL%FOUND.
  - Add translation of column in trigger event test with IS DISTINCT,
    for example: IF updating('ID') THEN ... will be translated into:
    IF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' AND NEW.'ID' IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.'ID' then...
  - Replace UTL_MATH.EDIT_DISTANCE function by fuzzymatch levenshtein.
  - Allow use of MODIFY_STRUCT with TABLE export. Table creation DDL
    will respect the new list of columns and all indexes or foreign
    key pointing to or from a column removed will not be exported.
  - Add export of partition and subpartition using PostgreSQL native
    partitioning.
  - Auto detect encrypted columns and report them into the assessment.
    SHOW_COLUMN will also mark columns as encrypted.
  - Add information to global temporary tables in migration assessment.
  - Add experimental DATADIFF functionality.
  - Allow use of multiprocess with -j option or JOBS to FUNCTION and
    PROCEDURE export. Useful if you have thousands of these objects.
  - Force RAW(N) type with default value set to sys_guid() as UUID
    on PostgreSQL.
  - Replace function with out parameter using select into. For example
    a call to:       get_item_attr( attr_name, p_value );
    where p_value is an INOUT parameter, will be rewritten as
    
    	p_value := get_item_attr( attr_name, p_value );
    
    If there is multiple OUT parameters, Ora2Pg will use syntax:
    
    	SELECT get_item_attr( attr_name, p_value )
		INTO (attr_name, p_value);

  - Add translation of CONNECT BY using PostgreSQL CTE equivalent.
    This translation also include a replacement of LEVEL and
    SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH native Oracle features. On complex queries
    there could still be manual editing but all the main work is done.
  - Add support to user defined exception, errcode affected to each
    custom exception start from 50001.
  - Translate call to to_char() with a single parameter into a cast
    to varchar. Can be disabled using USE_ORAFCE directive.
  - Improve ora2pg_scanner to automatically generates migration
    assessment reports for all schema on an Oracle instance. Before
    the schema name to audit was mandatory, now, when the schema
    is not set Ora2Pg will scan all schema. The connexion user need
    to have DBA privilege. Ora2Pg will also add the hostname and SID
    as prefix in the filename of the report. This last change forbids
    ora2pg_scanner to overwrite a report if the same schema name is
    found in several databases.

Several new configuration directives have been added:

  - Add USE_ORAFCE configuration directive that can be enabled if you
    want to use functions defined in the Orafce library and prevent
    Ora2Pg to translate call to these functions. The Orafce library
    can be found here: https://github.com/orafce/orafce
    By default Ora2pg rewrite add_month(), add_year(), date_trunc()
    and to_char() functions, but you may prefer to use the Orafce
    functions that do not need any code transformation. Directive
    DATE_FUNCTION_REWRITE has been removed as it was also used to
    disable replacement of add_month(), add_year() and date_trunc()
    when Orafce is used, useless now.
  - Add FILE_PER_FKEYS configuration directive to allow foreign key
    declaration to be saved in a separate file during schema export.
    By default foreign keys are exported into the main output file or
    in the CONSTRAINT_output.sql file. If enabled foreign keys will be
    exported into a file named FKEYS_output.sql
  - Add new COMMENT_COMMIT_ROLLBACK configuration directive. Call to
    COMMIT/ROLLBACK in PL/SQL code are kept untouched by Ora2Pg to
    force the user to review the logic of the function. Once it is
    fixed in Oracle source code or you want to comment this calls
    enable the directive.
  - Add CREATE_OR_REPLACE configuration directive. By default Ora2Pg
    use CREATE OR REPLACE in function DDL, if you need not to override
    existing functions disable this configuration directive, DDL will
    not include OR REPLACE.
  - Add FUNCTION_CHECK configuration directive. Disable this directive
    if you want to disable check_function_bodies.
    
    	SET check_function_bodies = false;
    
    It disables validation of the function body string during CREATE
    FUNCTION. Default is to use de postgresql.conf setting that enable
    it by default.
  - Add PG_SUPPORTS_PARTITION directive, disabled by default.
    PostgreSQL version prior to 10.0 do not have native partitioning.
    Enable this directive if you want to use PostgreSQL declarative
    partitioning instead of the old style check constraint and trigger.
  - Add PG_SUPPORTS_SUBSTR configuration directive to replace substr()
    call with substring() on old PostgreSQL versions or some fork
    like Redshift.
  - Add PG_INITIAL_COMMAND to send some statements at session startup.
    This directive is the equivalent used for Oracle connection,
    ORA_INITIAL_COMMAND. Both can now be used multiple time now.
  - Add DBLINK_CONN configuration directive. By default if you have
    an autonomous transaction translated using dblink extension the
    connection is defined using the values set with PG_DSN, PG_USER
    and PG_PWD. If you want to fully override the connection string
    use this directive to set the connection in the autonomous
    transaction wrapper function. For example:
    
        DBLINK_CONN    port=5432 dbname=pgdb host=localhost user=pguser password=pgpass
    
  - Add STRING_CONSTANT_REGEXP configuration directive. Ora2Pg replace
    all string constant during the pl/sql to plpgsql translation,
    string constant are all text include between single quote. If you
    have some string placeholder used in dynamic call to queries you
    can set a list of regexp to be temporary replaced to not break the
    parser. For example:
    
    	STRING_CONSTANT_REGEXP         <cfqueryparam value=".*">
    
    The list of regexp must use the semi colon as separator.
  - Add FUNCTION_STABLE configuration directive. By default Oracle
    functions are marked as STABLE as they can not modify data unless
    when used in PL/SQL with variable assignment or as conditional
    expression. You can force Ora2Pg to create these function as
    VOLATILE by disabling this configuration directive.
  - Add new TO_NUMBER_CONVERSION configuration directive to control
    TO_NUMBER translation behavior. By default Oracle call to function
    TO_NUMBER will be translated as a cast into numeric. For example,
    TO_NUMBER('10.1234') is converted into PostgreSQL call:
        to_number('10.1234')::numeric.
    If you want you can cast the call to integer or bigint by changing
    the value of the configuration directive. If you need better
    control of the format, just set it as value, for example:
	TO_NUMBER_CONVERSION    99999999999999999999D9999999999
    will convert the code above as:
          TO_NUMBER('10.1234', '99999999999999999999D9999999999')
    Any value of the directive that it is not numeric, integer or
    bigint will be taken as a mask format. If set to none, then no
    conversion will be done.
  - Add LOOK_FORWARD_FUNCTION configuration directive which takes a
    list of schema to get functions/procedures meta information that
    are used in the current schema export. When replacing call to
    function with OUT or INOUT parameters, if a function is declared
    in an other package then the function call rewriting can not be
    done because Ora2Pg only knows about functions declared in the
    current schema. By setting a comma separated list of schema as
    value of the directive, Ora2Pg will look forward in these packages
    for all functions, procedures and packages declaration before
    proceeding to current schema export.
  - Add PG_SUPPORTS_NAMED_OPERATOR to control the replacement of the
    PL/SQL operator used in named parameter => with the PostgreSQL
    proprietary operator := Disable this directive if you are using
    PG < 9.5
  - Add a warning when Ora2Pg reorder the parameters of a function
    following the PostgreSQL rule that all input parameters following
    a parameter with a default value must have default values as well.
    In this case, Ora2Pg extracts all parameters with default values
    and put them at end of the parameter list. This is to warn you
    that a manual rewrite is required on calls to this function.

New command line options have been added:

  - Add -N | --pg_schema command line option to be able to override
    the PG_SCHEMA configuration directive. When this option is set
    at command line, EXPORT_SCHEMA is automatically activated.
  - Add --no_header option with equivalent NO_HEADER configuration
    directive to output the Ora2Pg header but just the translated
    code.

There is also some behavior changes from previous release:

  - Remove SysTimestamp() from the list of not translated function,
    it is replaced with CURRENT_TIMESTAMP for a long time now.
  - Change migration assessment cost to 84 units (1 day) for type
    TABLE, INDEX and SYNONYM and to 168 units (2 days) for TABLE
    PARTITION and GLOBAL TEMPORARY TABLE, this is more realistic.
  - Set minimum assessment unit to 1 when an object exists.
    Improve PL/SQL code translation speed.
  - Change behavior of COMPILE_SCHEMA directive used to force Oracle
    to compile schema before exporting code. When this directive is
    enabled and SCHEMA is set to a specific schema name, only invalid
    objects in this schema will be recompiled. When SCHEMA is not set
    then all schema will be recompiled. To force recompile invalid
    object in a specific schema, set COMPILE_SCHEMA to the schema name
    you want to recompile. This will ask to Oracle to validate the
    PL/SQL that could have been invalidate after a export/import for
    example. The 'VALID' or 'INVALID' status applies to functions,
    procedures, packages and user defined types.
  - Default transaction isolation level is now set to READ COMMITTED
    for all action excluding data export.
  - Oracle doesn't allow the use of lookahead expression but you may
    want to exclude some objects that match the ALLOW regexp you have
    defined. For example if you want to export all table starting
    with E but not those starting with EXP it is not possible to do
    that in a single expression.
    Now you can start a regular expression with the ! character to
    exclude all objects matching the regexp given just after. Our
    previous example can be written as follow:   ALLOW   E.* !EXP.*
    it will be translated into
    
    	 REGEXP_LIKE(..., '^E.*$') AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(..., '^EXP.*$')
    
    in the object search expression.
  - Fix quoting of PG_SCHEMA with multiple schema in search path. The
    definition of the search path now follow the following behavior:
      * when PG_SCHEMA is define, always set search_path to its value.
      * when EXPORT_SCHEMA is enabled and SCHEMA is set, the search_path
        is set the name of the schema.
  - Remove forcing of export_schema when pg_schema is set at command
    line. This could change the behavior of some previous use of these
    variables and the resulting value of the search_path but it seems
    much better understandable.
  - Rewrite translation of raise_application_error to use RAISE
    EXCEPTION with a message and the SQLSTATE code. Oracle user
    defined code -20000 to -20999 are translated to PostgreSQL 
    user define code from 45000 to 45999. Call to
  	raise_application_error(mySQLCODE, myErrmsg);
    will be translated into
   	RAISE EXCEPTION '%', myErrmsg USING ERRCODE = mySQLCODE;
  - Remove migration assessment cost for TG_OP and NOT_FOUND they
    might be fully covered now.

2017 02 17 - v18.1

This release fix several issues reported on outer join translation
thanks to the help of Pavel Stehule and reapply the commit on virtual
column export that was accidentally removed from v18.0. It also adds
several new features:

  - Remove CHECK constraints for columns converted into boolean using
    REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN column.
  - Oracle function are now marked as stable by default as they can
    not modify data.

Two new configuration directives have been added:

  - DATE_FUNCTION_REWRITE: by default Ora2pg rewrite add_month(),
    add_year() and date_trunc() functions set it to 0 to force Ora2Pg
    to not translate those functions if translated code is broken.
  - GRANT_OBJECT: when exporting GRANT you can now specify a comma
    separated list of objects which privileges must be exported.
    Default is to export privileges for all objects. For example
    set it to TABLE if you just want to export privilege on tables.

and a new command line option:

  - Add -g | --grant_object command line option to ora2pg to be able
    to extract privilege from the given object type. See possible values
    with GRANT_OBJECT configuration directive.

Here is the complete list of changes:

  - Remove empty output.sql file in current directory with direct data
    import. Thanks to kuzmaka for the report.
  - Fix shell replacement of $$ in function definition in Makefile.PL
    embedded configuration file. Thanks to kuzmaka for the report.
  - Fix shell replacement of backslash in Makefile.PL embedded
    configuration file. Thanks to kuzmaka for the report.
  - Add warning level to virtual column notice.
  - Fix comment in where clause breaking the outer join association.
    Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Add parsing and support of virtual column from DDL file.
  - Reapply commit on virtual column export that was accidentally
    removed in commit d5866c9. Thanks to Alexey for the report.
  - Fix mix of inner join and outer join not translated correctly.
    Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the help to solve this issue.
  - Fix additional comma in column DEFAULT value from DDL input file.
    Thanks to Cynthia Shang for the report.
  - Fix comments inside FROM clause breaking translation to ANSI outer
    joins. Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Fix replacement of sdo_geometry type into function. Thanks to
    Saber Chaabane for the report.
  - Fix subquery in outer join clause. Thanks to Saber Chaabane for
    the report.
  - Fix duplicated subqueries placeholder in the from clause.
    Thanks to Saber Chaabane for the report.
  - Fix replacement of subquery place older during outer join rewrite.
    Thanks to Saber Chaabane for the report.
  - Add DATE_FUNCTION_REWRITE configuration directive. By default
    Ora2pg rewrite add_month(), add_year() and date_trunc() functions
    set it to 0 to force Ora2Pg to not translate those functions if
    translated code is broken. Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the feature
    request.
  - Do not report error when -g is used but action is not GRANT.
    Thanks to Shane Jimmerson for the report.
  - Oracle function can not modify data, only procedure can do that,
    so mark them as stable. Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Missed some obvious combination like upper/lower case or no space
    after AND/OR on outer join parsing and some other issues.
  - Add missing call to extract_subqueries() recursively. Thanks to
    Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Add full support of outer join translation in sub queries.
  - Add translation of mixed inner join and Oracle outer join. Thanks
    to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Fix missing space between keyword AS and END from the decode()
    transformation. Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Fix parsing of outer join with UNION and translation to left join.
    Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Remove CHECK constraints for columns converted into boolean using
    REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN column. Thanks to Shane Jimmerson for the
    feature request.
  - Fix regression on SQL and PLSQL rewrite when a text constant
    contained a semi-comma.
  - Add the GRANT_OBJECT configuration directive. When exporting GRANT
    you can specify a comma separated list of objects for which the
    privileges will be exported. Default is export for all objects.
    Here are the possibles values TABLE, VIEW, MATERIALIZED VIEW,
    SEQUENCE, PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, PACKAGE BODY, TYPE, SYNONYM and
    DIRECTORY. Only one object type is allowed at a time. For example
    set it to TABLE if you just want to export privilege on tables.
    You can use the -g option to overwrite it.  
    When used this directive prevent the export of users unless it is
    set to USER. In this case only users definitions are exported.
  - Add the -g | --grant_object command line option to ora2pg to be able
    to extract privilege from the given object type. See possible values
    with GRANT_OBJECT configuration directive.
  - Improve replacement of ROWNUM by LIMIT+OFFSET clause.
  - Fix extra semi-colon at end of statement.
  - Override ora2pg.spec with Devrim's one but with String::Random
    removing as it is no more used.

2017 01 29 - v18.0

This new major release adds several new useful features and lot of
improvements.

  * Automatic rewrite of simple form of (+) outer join Oracle's
    syntax. This major feature makes Ora2Pg become the first free
    tool that is able to rewrite automatically (+) outer join in
    command line mode. This works with simple form of outer join
    but this is a beginning.
  * Add export of Oracle's virtual column using a real column and
    a trigger.
  * Allow conversion of RAW/CHAR/VARCHAR2 type with precision in
    DATA_TYPE directive. Useful for example to transform all RAW(32)
    or VARCHAR2(32) columns into PostgreSQL special type uuid.
  * Add export NOT VALIDATED state from Oracle foreign keys and check
    constraints into NOT VALID constraints in PostgreSQL.
  * Replace call to SYS_GUID() with uuid_generate_v4() by default.
  * Add "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS dblink;" before an autonomous
    transaction or "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_background;".
  * Major rewrite of the way Ora2Pg parse PL/SQL to rewrite function
    calls and other PL/SQL to plpgsql replacement. There should not
    be any limitation in rewriting when a function contains a sub
    query or an other function call inside his parameters.
  * Refactoring of ora2pg to not requires any dependency other than
    the Perl DBI module by default. All DBD drivers are now optionals
    and ora2pg will expect an Oracle DDL file as input by default.
  * Add export of Oracle's global variables defined in package. They
    are exported as user defined custom variables and available in
    a session. If the variable is a constant or have a default value
    assigned at declaration, ora2pg will create a new file with the
    declaration (global_variables.conf) to be included in the main
    configuration file postgresql.conf file.
  * Create full text search configuration when USE_UNACCENT directive
    is enabled using the auto detected stemmer or the one defined in
    FTS_CONFIG. For example:
  	CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION fr (COPY = french);
    	ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION fr ALTER MAPPING FOR
    		hword, hword_part, word WITH unaccent, french_stem;
    	CREATE INDEX place_notes_cidx ON places
    			USING gin(to_tsvector('fr', place_notes));
    
Changes and incompatibilities from previous release:

  * FTS_INDEX_ONLY is now enabled by default because the addition of
    a column is not always possible and not always necessary where a
    simple function-based index is enough.
  * Remove use to setweigth() on single column FTS based indexes.
  * Change default behaviour of Ora2Pg in Full Text Search index
    export.

A new command line option and some configuration directive have
been added:

  * Option -D | --data_type to allow custom data type replacement
    at command line like in configuration file with DATA_TYPE.
  * UUID_FUNCTION to be able to redefined the function called to
    replace SYS_GUID() Oracle function. Default to uuid_generate_v4.
  * REWRITE_OUTER_JOIN to be able to disable the rewriting of Oracle
    native syntax (+) into OUTER JOIN if rewritten code is broken.
  * USE_UNACCENT and USE_LOWER_UNACCENT configuration directives to
    use the unaccent extension with pg_trgm with the FTS indexes.
  * FTS_INDEX_ONLY, by default Ora2Pg creates an extra tsvector column
    with a dedicated triggers for FTS indexes. Enable this directive
    if you just want a function-based index like:
	CREATE INDEX ON t_document USING
		gin(to_tsvector('pg_catalog.english', title));
  * FTS_CONFIG, use this directive to force the text search stemmer
    used with the to_tsvector() function. Default is to auto detect
    the Oracle FTS stemmer. For example, setting FTS_CONFIG to
    pg_catalog.english or pg_catalog.french will override the auto
    detected stemmer.

There's also lot fixes of issues reported by users from the past two
months, here is the complete list of changes:

  - Fix return type in function with a single inout parameter and a
    returned type.
  - Prevent wrong rewrite of empty as null when a function is used.
    Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Add the UUID_FUNCTION configuration directive. By default Ora2Pg
    will convert call to SYS_GUID() Oracle function with a call to
    uuid_generate_v4 from uuid-ossp extension. You can redefined it
    to use the gen_random_uuid function from pgcrypto extension by
    changing the function name. Default to uuid_generate_v4. Thanks
    to sjimmerson for the feature request.
  - Add rewrite of queries with simple form of left outer join syntax
    (+) into the ansi form.
  - Add new command line option -D | --data_type to allow custom data
    type replacement at command line like in configuration file with
    DATA_TYPE.
  - Fix type in ROWNUM replacement expression. Thanks to Pavel Stehule
    for the report.
  - Add replacement of SYS_GUID by uuid_generate_v4 and allow custom
    rewriting of RAW type. Thanks to Nicolas Martin for the report.

    to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Fix replacement of local type ref cursor. Thanks to Pavel Stehule
    for the report.
  - Add EXECUTE keyword to OPEN CURSOR ... FOR with dynamic query.
    Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.

  - Replace call to plsql_to_plpgsql() in Ora2Pg.pm by a call to new
    function convert_plsql_code().
  - Move export of constraints after indexes to be able to use USING
    index in constraint creation without error complaining that index
    does not exists.
  - Add "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS dblink;" before an autonomous
    transaction or "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_background;".
  - Improve parsing of packages DDL from file.
  - When a variable in "FOR varname IN" statement is not found in the
    DECLARE bloc, Ora2Pg will automatically add the variable to this
    bloc declared as a RECORD. Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Major rewrite of the way Ora2Pg parse PL/SQL to rewrite function
    calls and other PL/SQL to plpgsql replacement. There should not
    be limitation in rewriting when a function contains a sub query
    or an other function call inside his parameters.
  - Fix unwanted SELECT to PERFORM transformation inside literal
    strings. Thanks to Pavel Stehule for the report.
  - Fix bug in DEFAULT value rewriting. Thanks to Pavel Stehule for
    the report.
  - Fix replacement of DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line with RAISE NOTICE.
  - Reset global variable storage for each package.
  - Improve comment parsing in packages and prevent possible infinite
    loop in global variable replacement.
  - Add the REWRITE_OUTER_JOIN configuration directive to be able to
    disable the rewriting of Oracle native syntax (+) into OUTER JOIN
    if it is broken.  Default is to try to rewrite simple form of
    right outer join for the moment.
  - Export types and cursors declared as global objects in package
    spec header into the main output file for package export. Types
    and cursors declared into the package body are exported into the
    output file of the first function declared in this package.
  - Globals variables declared into the package spec header are now
    identified and replaced into the package code with the call to
    user defined custom variable. It works just like globals variables
    declared into the package body.
  - Add auto detection of Oracle FTS stemmer and disable FTS_CONFIG
    configuration directive per default. When FTS_CONFIG is set its
    value will overwrite the auto detected value.
  - Create full text search configuration when USE_UNACCENT directive
    is enabled using the auto detected stemmer or the one defined in
    FTS_CONFIG. For example:
  	CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION fr (COPY = french);
    	ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION fr ALTER MAPPING FOR
    		hword, hword_part, word WITH unaccent, french_stem;
    	CREATE INDEX place_notes_cidx ON places
    			USING gin(to_tsvector('fr', place_notes));
  - Remove CONTAINS(ABOUT()) from the migration assessment, there no
    additional difficulty to CONTAINS rewrite.
  - Add ANYDATA to the migration assessment keyword to detect.
  - Allow conversion of CHAR/VARCHAR2 type with precision in DATA_TYPE
    directive. For example it's possible to transform all VARCHAR2(32)
    columns only into PostgreSQL special type uuid by setting:
        DATA_TYPE	VARCHAR2(32):uuid
    Thanks to sjimmerson for the feature request.
  - Update year in copyrights
  - Fix creation of schema when CREATE_SCHEMA+PG_SCHEMA are defined.
  - Fix renaming of temporary file when exporting partitions.
  - Move MODIFY_TYPE to the type section
  - Update documentation about globals variables.
  - Add export of Oracle's global variables defined in package. They
    are exported as user defined custom variables and available in
    a session. Oracle variables assignment are exported as call to:
            PERFORM set_config('pkgname.varname', value, false);
    Use of these variable in the code is replaced by:
            current_setting('pkgname.varname')::global_variables_type;
    the variable type is extracted from the pacjkage definition. If
    the variable is a constant or have a default value assigned at
    declaration, ora2pg will create file global_variables.conf with
    the definition to include in postgresql.conf file so that their
    values will already be set at database connection. Note that the
    value can always modified by the user so you can not have exactly
    a constant.
  - Fix migration assessment of view.
  - Remove call to FROM SYS.DUAL, only FROM DUAL was replaced.
  - Replace call to trim into btrim.
  - Improve rewrite of DECODE when there is function call inside.
  - Add function replace_right_outer_join() to rewrite Oracle (+)
    right outer join.
  - Improve view migration assessment.
  - Create a FTS section in the configuration file dedicated to FTS
    control.
  - Add USE_UNACCENT and USE_LOWER_UNACCENT configuration directives
    to use the unaccent extension with pg_trgm.
  - Do not create FTS_INDEXES_* file when there is no Oracle Text
    indexes.
  - Update query test score when CONTAINS, SCORE, FUZZY, ABOUT, NEAR
    keyword are found.
  - Remove use to setweigth() on single column FTS based indexes.
    Thanks to Adrien Nayrat for the report.
  - Update documentation on FTS_INDEX_ONLY with full explanation on
    the Ora2Pg transformation.
  - Refactoring ora2pg to not requires any dependency other than the
    Perl DBI module by default. All DBD drivers are now optionals and
    ora2pg will expect to received an Oracle DDL file as input by
    default. This makes easiest packaging or for any distribution that
    can not build a package because of the DBD::Oracle requirement.
    DBD::Oracle, DBD::MySQL and DBD::Pg are still required if you want
    Ora2Pg to migrate your database "on-line" but they are optional
    because Ora2Pg can also convert input DDL file, this is the
    default now. Thanks to Gustavo Panizzo for the feature request and
    the work on Debian packaging.
  - Remove String::Random dependency in rpm spec file, it is no used
    even if it was mentioned into a comment.
  - Exclude internal Oracle Streams AQ JMS types from the export.
    Thanks to Joanna Xu for the report.
  - Fix some other spelling issues. Thanks to Gustavo Panizzo for the
    patch.
  - Fix some spelling errors. Thanks to Gustavo Panizzo for the patch.
  - Revert patch 697f09d that was breaking encoding with input file
    (-i). Thanks to Gary Evans for the report.
  - Add two new configuration directive to control FTS settings,
    FTS_INDEX_ONLY and FTS_CONFIG.
   
2016 11 17 - v17.6

This release adds several new features:

  * Adds export of Oracle Text Indexes into FTS or pg_trgm
    based indexes,
  * Add export of indexes defined on materialized views
  * Allow export of materialized views as foreign tables
    when export type is FDW.
  * Add replacement of trim() by btrim().

Two new configuration directives have been added:

  * USE_INDEX_OPCLASS: when value is set to 1, this will force
    Ora2Pg to export all indexes defined on varchar2() and char()
    columns using *_pattern_ops operators. If you set it to a value
    greater than 1 it will only change indexes on columns where the
    character limit is greater or equal than this value.

  * CONTEXT_AS_TRGM: when enabled it forces Ora2Pg to translate
    Oracle Text indexes into PostgreSQL indexes using pg_trgm
    extension. Default is to translate CONTEXT indexes into FTS
    indexes and CTXCAT indexes using pg_trgm. Some time using
    pg_trgm based indexes is enough.

There's also some fixes of issues reported by users, here is the
complete list of changes:

  - Fixed non-use of custom temp_dir (-T). Thanks to Sebastian
    Albert for the patch.
  - Make export of FTS indexes from materialized view work as
    for tables.
  - Fix drop of indexes during export of data when DROP_INDEXES
    is enabled.
  - Remove double quote in function and procedure name from an input
    file to avoid creating a file with double quote in its name.
  - Fix export of unique index associated to a primary key.
  - Move OPTION (key "yes") of FDW table before NOT NUL constraint
    and default clause.
  - Fix some encoding issue during data export into file.
  - Rename FTS indexes prefix output file into FTS_INDEXES and
    export CTXCAT Oracle indexes as GIN pg_trgm indexes instead of
    FTS indexes.
  - Add export of indexes of type CTXCAT as FTS indexes.
  - Export triggers and update order for FTS indexes to separate file
    prefixed with FTS_INDEXES.
  - Exclude from export synonyms starting with a slash that correspond
    to incomplete deleted synonyms. Thanks to Nouredine Mallem for the
    report.
  - Add export of indexes defined on materialized views. Thanks to
    Nouredine Mallem for the report.
  - Fix export of foreign key and FTS indexes when looking at dba_*
    tables and multiple different schemas have the same fk or context
    indexes definition. Thanks to Nouredine Mallemfor the patch.
  - Fix export of CONTEXT or FULLTEXT Oracle index into PostgreSQL
    FTS with trigger and initial update statement.
  - Add configuration directive USE_INDEX_OPCLASS to force Ora2Pg to
    export all indexes defined on varchar2() and char() columns using
    those operators. A value greater than 1 will only change indexes
    on columns where the character limit is greater or equal than
    this value.
  - Fix FDW export of mysql tables. Thanks to yafeishi for the report.
  - Fix decode() rewrite. Thanks to Jean-Yves Julliot for the report.
  - Fix regression introduced into the export of NUMBER to integer
    like PG types.
  - Show partition name in progress bar instead of main table name.

2016 10 20 - v17.5

This is a maintenance release to fix several issues reported by users.
There is also some major improvement and new feature.

There is a new configuration directive or change default behavior:

  * Fix export of CLOBs and NCLOB that was truncated to 64 Kb.
  * PG_BACKGROUND : when enabled autonomous transactions will be
    built using Robert Haas extension pg_background instead of dblink.
    Default is to still used dblink as pg_background is available
    only for PostgreSQL >= 9.5.
  * All Perl I/O now use the open pragma instead of calling method
    binmode(). This will force input and output to utf8 using the
    Perl pragma:
	use open ':encoding(utf8)';
    when configuration directive BINMODE is not set or NLS_LANG is
    set to UTF8.
  * Ora2Pg will now export empty lob as empty string instead of NULL
    when the source column has NOT NULL constraint and that directive
    EMPTY_LOB_NULL is not activated.
  * Improve and fix progress bar especially when using JOBS/-J option.
  * Allow LOAD action to apply all settings defined in the input file
    on each opened session, this allow to use LOAD with export schema
    enabled. If settings are not set in the input file encoding and
    search_path is set from the ora2pg configuration settings.
  * NUMBER(*,0) is now exported as numeric(38) as well as a NUMBER
    with DATA_SCALE set to 0, no DATA_PRECISION and a DATA_LENGTH
    of 22. The last correspond to Oracle type INTEGER or INT.
  * Allow conversion of type with precision in DATA_TYPE directive.
    For example it is possible to transform all NUMBER(12,2) only
    into numeric(12,2) by escaping the comma. Example:
    	DATA_TYPE	NUMBER(12\,2):numeric(12\,2);...
  * Write data exported into temporary files (prefixed by tmp_) and
    renamed them at end of the export to be able to detect incomplete
    export and override it at next export.
  * Add export of type created in package declaration.
  * Export foreign key when the referenced table is not in the
    same schema.
  * Enabled by default PG_SUPPORTS_CHECKOPTION assuming that your Pg
    destination database is at least a 9.4 version.
  * Add 12 units to migration assessment report per table/column
    conflicting with a reserved word in PostgreSQL to reflect the
    need of code rewriting.
  * Output a warning when a column has the same name than a system
    column (xmin,xmax,ctid,etc.)
  * Replace SYSDATE by a call to clock_timestamp() instead of a call
    to LOCALTIMESTAMP in plpgsql code.
  * Add missing documentation about DISABLE_PARTITION directive used
    to not reproduce partitioning into PostgreSQL and only export
    partitioned data into the main table.
  * Show partition name in progress bar instead of main table name.

Here is the complete list of other changes:

  - Fix broken parallel table export (-P option).
  - Fix export of CLOBs and NCLOB that was truncated to 64Kb. Thanks
    to Paul Mzko for the patch.
  - Fix database handle in error report.
  - Fix use of wrong database handle to set search_path. Thanks to
    Paul Mzko for the report.
  - Ora2pg doesn't export schema ForeignKey constraint when connected
    as different DBA user. Thanks to Paul Mzko for the patch.
  - Fix Perl I/O encoding using open pragma instead of calling method
    binmode(). Thanks to Gary Evans for the report.
  - Force input to utf8 using Perl pragma: use open ':encoding(utf8)';
    when BINMODE is not set or NLS_LANG is UTF8.
  - Force ora2pg to export empty lob as empty string instead of NULL
    when the source column has a NOT NULL constraint and directive
    EMPTY_LOB_NULL is not activated. Thanks to Valeriy for the report.
  - Fix missing CASCADE attribute on fkey creation during data export
    when DROP_FKEY was enabled. Thanks to ilya makarov for the report.
  - Fix issue on converting NUMBER(*,0) to numeric, should be ported
    to numeric(38). Thanks to ilya makarov for the report.
  - Correct query for ForeignKey export from oracle. Thanks to ilya
    makarov for the patch.
  - Fix schema change in direct import of data to PostgreSQL.
  - Change query for foreign key extraction to keep the column order.
    Thanks to ilya makarov for the report.
  - Write data exported into temporary files (prefixed by tmp_) and
    renamed them at end of the export to be able to detect incomplete
    export and override it at next export. Thanks to Paul Mkzo for
    the feature request.
  - Fix infinite loop in blob extraction when error ORA-25408 occurs
    during ora_lob_read() call. Thanks to Paul Mzko for the report.
  - Fix order of columns in foreign keys definition. Thanks to ilya
    makarov for the report.
  - Fix export of partition by range on multicolumn. Thanks to Rupesh
    Admane for the report.
  - Update reserved keywords list. Thanks to Nicolas Gollet for the
    report.
  - Add ON DELETE NO ACTION on foreign key creation (DROP_FKEY) to
    obtain the same output than during constraints export.
  - Fix export of foreign key that was duplicating the columns in both
    part, local and foreign. Thanks to ilya makarov for the report.
  - Remove call to to_char(datecol, format) when exporting date and
    timestamp. This formating is no more needed as we are now forcing
    NLS_DATE_FORMAT and NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT when opening a connection
    to Oracle using:
    	ALTER SESSION SET NLS_DATE_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS
    and
    	ALTER SESSION SET NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT='YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS
    This may result on some speed improvment during data export.
  - Fix parsing of packages from input file.
  - Add export of type created in package declaration. Thanks to
    dezdechado  for the report.
  - Fix converting of procedures with out arguments. Thanks to
    dezdechado for the report.
  - Update documentation about project management.
  - Fix replacement of = NULL by IS NULL in update statement.
    Thanks to dezdechado for the report.
  - Fix parsing of trigger from file that was broken and new line
    removed. Thanks to dezdechado for the report.
  - Fix erasing of quotes from text in triggers. Thanks to dezdechado
    for the report.
  - Fix "return new" on trigger function when there is exception.
    Thanks to dezdechado for the report and solution.
  - Fix conversion of INTEGER and INT into numeric(38) instead of
    numeric without precision. Thanks to dezdechado for the report.
  - Fix export of foreign key when the referenced table is not in the
    same schema. Thanks to Juju for the report.
  - Fix ddl create schema when EXPORT_SCHEMA and CREATE_SCHEMA are
    enabled but no schema is specified.
  - Fix export of NCHAR that was converted as char but was loosing its
    length definition. Thanks to lgerlandsen for the report.
  - Fix parsing of views using WITH statements. Thank to dezdechado
    for the report.
  - Fix case that breaks views/triggers definition when a semicolon
    is encountered in a string value when reading definition from
    file. Thanks to dezdechado for the report.
  - Fix included/excluded of sequences when using ALLOW/EXCLUDE
    directives. Thanks to Roman Sindelar for the report.
  - prepare options modified with some escaping improvements. Thanks
    to ioxgrey for the patch.
  - It seems that for a NUMBER with a DATA_SCALE set to 0, no
    DATA_PRECISION and a DATA_LENGTH of 22 in ALL_TAB_COLUMNS, Oracle
    use a NUMBER(38) instead. This correspond to Oracle type INTEGER
    or INT. I don't really understand the reason of this behavior,
    why not just using a data length of 38? ALL_TAB_COLUMNS and Ora2Pg
    reports a data length of 22, now Ora2Pg will report NUMBER(38) like
    the resulting type of the DESC command.
    
    The following Oracle table:
    
    	CREATE TABLE TEST_TABLE ( FIELD_1 INTEGER, FIELD_2 NUMBER );
    
    will be exported as follow by Ora2Pg:
    
    [1] TABLE TEST_TABLE (owner: HR, 0 rows)
    	FIELD_1 : NUMBER(38) => numeric
    	FIELD_2 : NUMBER(22) => bigint
    
    Oracle data type INTEGER and INT will be exported as numeric by
    default instead of an integer.
  - Fix parsing of function/procedure from file with comments after
    BEGIN statement.
  - Remove DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED from CHECK constraints when
    parsed from file. Thanks to Felipe Lavoura for the report.
  - Fix double parenthesis in index definition when parsing index
    creation from file. Thanks to Felipe Lavoura for the report.
  - Fix parsing of COMMENT from file.
  - Fix undetected native Oracle type bug. Thanks to kvnema for the
    report.
  - Fix unwanted text formatting with bind value in INSERT action
    with direct import to PostgreSQL. Thanks to Oleg for the report.
  - Fix inversion of UPDATE_RULE and DELETE_RULE in foreign key
    creation for MySQL export. Thanks to Sebastian Albert for the
    report.
  - Update documentation about DEFER_FKEY and DROP_FKEY to report
    the new behavior.
  - Remove call to SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED with direct import.
  - Fix use of NULL value in bind parameter that should be undefined
    (INSERT export mode only). Thanks to Oleg barabaka for the report.
  - Remove replacement of direct call to functions with PERFORM, there
    is too much false positive. Thanks to dezdechado for the reports.
  - Fix a typo in SYSDATE replacement. Thank to dezdechado for report.
  - Remove rewrite of concatenation in RAISE EXCEPTION. Thanks to
    dezdechado for the report.

    LOCALTIMESTAMP in plpgsql code. Thanks to aleksaan for the report.
  - Allow use of comma for object name list separator instead of space
    as workaround on Window OS.
  - Fix documentation about MODIFY_TYPE. Thanks to Nicolas Gollet for
    the report.
  - Add missing documentation about DISABLE_PARTITION directive used
    to not reproduce partitioning into PostgreSQL and only export
    partitioned data into the main table. Thanks to Nicolas Gollet
    for the report.
  - Add information about how to export LONG RAW data type. They need
    to be exported as BLOB before into Oracle to be exported as BYTEA.
  - Fix case where select was wrongly replaced by perform in INSERT
    INTO with SELECT statement. Thanks to dezdechado for the report.
  - Fix links to ora2pg presentation. Thanks to Daniel Lenski for the
    patch.
  - Fix input parameters after one with a default value must also have
    defaults. Thanks to v.agapov fot the patch.

    Thanks to calbiston for the report.

2016 04 21 - v17.4

Errata in first release attempt.

  - Fix previous patch that does not handle blob case but just clob
  - Forgot to change back the query when EMPTY_LOB_NULL is not activated.
  - Put parenthesis around AT TIME ZONE expression

This is a maintenance release to fix several issues reported by users.
There is also some major data export speed improvement thanks to the
work of PostgreSQL Pro and a new RPM spec file provided by Devrim
Gunduz to be able to build RPM package for Ora2Pg.

There is a new configuration directive:

    to be exported as NULL instead as empty string. This might improve
    data export speed if you have lot of empty lob. Thanks to Alex
    Ignatov for the report.
  - Fix import_all.sh script to import grant and tablespace separately
    as postgres user and just after indexes and constraints creation.

This is a maintenance release to fix several issues reported in new
TEST action. There is also some feature improvement:

  * Add OPTIONS (key 'true') on table FDW export when a column is
    detected as a primary key.
  * Add DELETE configuration directive that allow a similar feature
    than the WHERE clause to replace TRUNCATE call by a "DELETE FROM
    table WHERE condition". This feature can be useful with regular
    "updates". Thanks to Sebastien Albert for the feature request.

Here is the complete list of other changes:

  - Update documentation about the TEST action and usage, see
    chapter "Test the migration".
  - Apply schema context on PostgreSQL side with TEST action.
  - Add TEST action type to ask Ora2Pg to count rows and all objects
    at both sides, Oracle and PostgreSQL, to verify that everything
    have been well imported.
  - Fix missing export of foreign keys on multiple columns, ex:
	ALTER TABLE products ADD CONSTRAINT fk_supplier_comp
		FOREIGN KEY (supplier_id,supplier_name)
		REFERENCES supplier(supplier_id,supplier_name)...
  - Fix import of BLOB data using INSERT statements into the bytea.
    Thanks to rballer for the patch.

    for the report.
  - Fix position of TG_OP condition when an exception is defined.
    Thanks to Raqua for the report.
  - Fix wrong replacement of SELECT with PERFORM when a comment was
    found between an open parenthesis and the select statement.
    Thanks to Raqua for the report.

    for the report.
  - Fix missing index name in indexes creation. Thanks to Raqua for
    the report.
  - Fix pg DSN in import_all.sh autogenerated script.
  - Fix extraction of trigger. When the name of a column or something
    contained INSERTING, DELETING or UPDATING was converted to TG_OP
    = 'INSERT' or corresponding event. Thanks to Stanislaw Jankowski
    for the patch.
  - Fix multiple use of same column in check constraint and indexes
    of partitions when there was several schema with the same objects.

2015 11 30 - v16.1

This release fixes several issues and adds some very useful features:

    * Generate automatically a new import_all.sh shell script when using option
      --init_project to help automate all import into PostgreSQL.

	See sh import_all.sh -? for more information.

    * Export Oracle bitmap index as PostgreSQL btree_gin index. This require the
      btree_gin extension and PostgreSQL >= 9.4. This is the default.

    * Auto set DEFINED_PK to the first column of a table that have a unique key
      defined that is a NUMBER. This allow data of any table with a numeric
      unique key to be extracted using multiple connexions to Oracle using -J
      option. Tables with no numeric unique key will be exported with a single
      process.

    * Improve BLOB export speed by using hex encoding instead of escape. This
      might speed up be BLOB export by 10.

    * Allow use of LOB locator to retrieve BLOB and CLOB data to prevent having
      to set LONGREADLEN. Now LONGREADLEN is set to 8KB. Old behavior using
      LONGREADLEN can still be enabled by setting NO_LOB_LOCATOR to 0, given
      for backward compatibility. Default is to use LOB locator.

    * Ora2Pg will also auto detect table with BLOB and automatically decrease
      DATA_LIMIT to a value lower or equal to 1000. This is to prevent OOM.

    * Improving indexes and constraints creation speed by using the LOAD action
      and a file containing SQL orders to perform. It is possible to dispatch
      those orders over multiple PostgreSQL connections. To be able to use this
      feature, PG_DSN, PG_USER and PG_PWD must be set. Then:

	ora2pg -t LOAD -c config/ora2pg.conf -i schema/tables/INDEXES_table.sql -j 4
    
      will dispatch indexes creation over 4 simultaneous PostgreSQL connections.
    
      This will considerably accelerate this part of the migration process with
      huge data size.

    * Domain indexes are now exported as b-tree but commented to let you know
      where possible FTS are required.

    * Add number of refresh ON COMMIT materialized view in detailed report.

    * Allow redefinition of numeric type, ex: NUMBER(3)::bigint to fix wrong
      original definition in Oracle.

    * Allow export of all schemas from an Oracle Instance when SCHEMA directive
      is empty and EXPORT_SCHEMA is enabled. All exported objects will be
      prefixed with the name of their original Oracle schema or search_path will
      be set to that schema name. Thanks to Magnus Hagander for the feature
      request.
 
    * Allow use of COPY FREEZE to export data when COPY_FREEZE is enabled. This
      will only works with export to file and when -J or ORACLE_COPIES is not
      set or default to 1. It can be used with direct import into PostgreSQL
      under the same condition but -j or JOBS must be unset or default to 1.
      Thanks to Magnus Hagander for the feature request.

Some new configuration directives:
 
    * BITMAP_AS_GIN: enable it to use btree_gin extension to create bitmap
      like index with pg >= 9.4. You will need to create the extension by
      yourself: "create extension btree_gin;". Default is to create GIN index,
      when disabled, a btree index will be created.
    * NO_LOB_LOCATOR: to disable use of LOB locator and extract BLOB "inline"
      using a less or more high value in LONGREADLEN.
    * BLOB_LIMIT: to force the value of DATA_LIMIT for tables with BLOB. Default
      is to automatically set this limit using the following code:
	BLOB_LIMIT=DATA_LIMIT; while (BLOB_LIMIT > 1000) BLOB_LIMIT /= 10
    * COPY_FREEZE: use it to use COPY FREEZE instead of simple COPY to speedup
      import into PostgreSQL.

Here is the complete list of other changes:

  - Limite package function name rewrite to call with parenthesis after the
    function name to avoid rewriting names of other objects.
  - Fix extra replacement of function name with package prefix. On some
    condition it was done multiple time.
  - Set REPLACE_ZERO_DATE to -INFINITY in generic configuration when --mysql
    is enabled.
  - Fix extraction of partition with MySQL that was not limited to a single
    database.
  - Do some replacement on ORACLE_DNS and SCHEMA into generic configuration
    when --mysql is used for better understanding.
  - Add call to round() on -J parallelization when the auto detected column
    is a numeric with scale.
  - Add COMMIT to the difficulties migration assessment keywords as it need
    context analyzing.
  - Add call to cursor's %ROWCOUNT, %ISOPEN and %NOTFOUND to difficulties
    migration assessment keywords.
  - Replace call to CURSOR%ROWTYPE by RECORD. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
    report.
  - Fix ALTER FUNCTION ... OWNER TO ... and REVOKE statement where functions
    parameters were missing.
  - Add Get_Env to the Oracle functions list for migration assessment.
  - Disable variable NO_LOB_LOCATOR and set LONGREADLEN to 8192 bytes to use
    LOB locators to extract BLOB in generic configuration file.

2015 10 15 - v16.0

This major release improve PL/SQL code replacement, fixes several bugs and
adds some major new features:

  * Full migration of MySQL database, it just work like with Oracle database.
  * Full migration assessment report for MySQL database.
  * New script, ora2pg_scanner, to perform a migration assessment of all
    Oracle and MySQL instances on a network.
  * Add technical difficulty level in migration assessment.
  * Allow migration assessment on client queries extracted from AUDIT_TRAIL
    (oracle) or general_log table (mysql).
  * Ora2Pg has a "made in one night" brand new Web site (still need some work).
    See http://ora2pg.darold.net/

Example of technical difficulty level assessment output for the sakila database
with some more difficulties:

	Total	83.90 cost migration units means approximatively 1 man-day(s).
	Migration level: B-5

Here are the explanation of the migration level code:

    Migration levels:
	A - Migration that might be run automatically
	B - Migration with code rewrite and a human-days cost up to 10 days
	C - Migration with code rewrite and a human-days cost above 10 days
    Technical levels:
	1 = trivial: no stored functions and no triggers
	2 = easy: no stored functions but with triggers, no manual rewriting
	3 = simple: stored functions and/or triggers, no manual rewriting
	4 = manual: no stored functions but with triggers or views with code
	            rewriting
	5 = difficult: stored functions and/or triggers with code rewriting

This is to help you to find the database that can be migrated first with small
efforts (A and B) and those who need to conduct a full migration project (C).

This release has also some new useful features:

  * Export type SHOW_TABLE now shows additional information about table type
    (FOREIGN, EXTERNAL or PARTITIONED with the number of partition).
  * Connection's user and password can be passed through environment variables
    ORA2PG_USER and ORA2PG_PASSWD to avoid setting them at ora2pg command line.
  * Improve PL/SQL replacement on ADD_MONTH(), ADD_YEAR(), TRUNC(), INSTR() and
    remove the replacement limitation on DECODE().
  * Add detection of migration difficulties in views, was previously reserved
    to functions, procedures, packages and triggers.
  * Replace values in auto generated configuration file from command line
    options -s, -n, -u and -p when --init_project is used.
  * Adjust lot of scores following new functionalities in Ora2Pg, ex: dblink or
    synomyms are now easy to migrate.

There is some new command line options to ora2pg script:

  * -m | --mysql : to be used with --init_project and -i option to inform
    ora2pg that we work with a MySQL format
  * -T | --temp_dir : option to be able to set a distinct temporary directory
    to run ora2pg in parallel.
  * --audit_user : option to set the user used in audit filter and enable
    migration assessment report on queries from AUDIT_TRAIL (oracle) or
    general_log table (mysql).
  * --dump_as_sheet and --print_header options to be able to compute a CSV
    file with all migration assessment from a list of oracle database.
  * --dump_as_csv option to report assessments into a csv file. It will not
    include comments or details, just objects names, numbers and cost.

Backward compatibility:

  - Change NULL_EQUAL_EMPTY to be disabled by default to force change in the
    application instead of transforming the PL/SQL.

This release adds some new configuration directives:

  * MYSQL_PIPES_AS_CONCAT: Enable it if double pipe and double ampersand
    (|| and &&) should not be taken as equivalent to OR and AND.
  * MYSQL_INTERNAL_EXTRACT_FORMAT: Enable it if you want EXTRACT() replacement
    to use the internal format returned as an integer.
  * AUDIT_USER: Set the comma separated list of user name that must be used
    to filter from the DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL or general_log tables.
  * REPLACE_ZERO_DATE: "zero" date: 0000-00-00 00:00:00 it is replaced by a
    NULL by default, use it to use the date of your choice.
  * INDEXES_RENAMING: force renaming of all indexes using tablename_columnsname
    Very useful for database that have multiple time the same index name or
    that use the same name than a table.
  * HUMAN_DAYS_LIMIT: default to 5 days, used to set the number of human-days
    limit for migration of type C.

2015 06 01 - v15.3

This is a maintenance release only that fixes several minor bugs and typos.
The configuration file have been entirely rewritten to classify configuration
directives in section for better understanding.

Here is the full list of changes:

  - Ora2Pg will use DEFAULT_SRID when call to sdo_cs.map_oracle_srid_to_epsg()
    returns an ORA-01741 error. Mostly because there's no SRID defined for that
    column in ALL_SDO_GEOM_METADATA. The error message will still be displayed
    but a warning will explain the reason and ora2pg will continue with default
    value. Thanks to kazam for the report.
  - Add current setting for NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT and NLS_DATE_FORMAT to the
    SHOW_ENCODING report.
  - Change default value for GEOMETRY_EXTRACT_TYPE to INTERNAL instead of WKT.
  - Change generic configuration file behavior with BINMODE parameter commented
    if it was previously uncommented. This will force to use the default value.
  - Fix potential issue with max open file limit with unclosed temporary file.
    Thanks to Marc Clement for the report.
  - Fix use of SECURITY DEFINER in SYNONYM export.
  - Fix parsing of editable function/procedure/package from input DML file.
  - Fix case where variable $2 and $3 was null after a too early call of a new
    substitution in read_view_from_file(). Thanks to Alex Ignatov for the patch.
  - Add support to "create or replace editionable|noneditionable" from input DML
    files. Thanks to Alex Ignatov for the report.
  - Fix unknown column HIGH_VALUE from *_TAB_PARTITIONS in Oracle 8i. Thanks to
    Sebastian Fischer for the patch.
  - Fix call to ALL_MVIEW_LOGS object which not exists with Oracle 8i. Thanks to
    Sebastian Fischer for the report.
  - Fix Error ORA-22905 while Get the dimension of the geometry by looking at
    number of element in the SDO_DIM_ARRAY. Thanks to jkutterer for the patch.
  - Remove reordering export of view for Oracle database before 11g. Thanks to
    kyiannis for the report.
  - Fix several some typos and a bunch of misspelled. Thanks to Euler Taveira
    for all the patches.
  - Fix missing Oracle database version before looking at function security
    definer. Thanks to kyiannis for the report.

2015 04 13 - v15.2

This new minor release fixes some issues and adds two new configuration
directives:

  * ORA_INITIAL_COMMAND to be able to execute a custom command just after
    the connection to Oracle, for example to unlock a security policy.
  * INTERNAL_DATE_MAX to change the behavior of Ora2Pg with internal date
    found in user defined types.

This version will also automatically re-order exported views taking into
account interdependencies.

Here is the full list of changes:

    - Add INTERNAL_DATE_MAX configuration directive with default to 49 to be
      used when reformatting internal date returned with a user defined type
      and a timestamp column. DBD::Oracle only return the internal date format
      01-JAN-77 12.00.00.000000 AM so it is difficult to know if the year value
      must be added to 2000 or 1900. We takes the default behavior where date
      are between 1950 and 2049.
    - Remove extra CHAR and BYTE information from column type. Thanks to Magnus
      Hagander for the report.
    - Re-order views taking into account interdependencies. Thanks to Kuppusamy
      Ravindran and Ulrike for the suggestion and the Oracle query.
    - Fix case sensitivity in function based indexes. Thanks to Kuppusamy
      Ravindran for the report.
    - Fix PERFORM wrong replacement and infinite loop processing DECODE in some
      condition. Thanks to Didier Brugat for the report.
    - Fix replacement of boolean value in DEFAULT value at table creation.
      Thanks to baul87 for the report.
    - Add ORA_INITIAL_COMMAND configuration directive to be able to execute a
      custom command just after the connection to Oracle, to unlock a policy for
      example. Thanks to Didier BRUGAT for the feature request.
    - Fix alias in from clause when an XML type is found. Thanks to Lance Jacob
      for the record.
    - Invert condition on excluding temporary file with Windows OS. Thanks to
      kazam for the report.
    - Remove start time and global number of rows from _dump_table() parameters
      they are not used anymore.
    - Remove use of temporary file on Windows operating system.
    - Disable parallel table export when operating system is Windows.
    - Fix export of objects with case sensitivity using ALLOW or EXCLUDE
      directives. Thanks to Alexey Ignatov for the report.
    - Fix export of triggers from recycle bin.
    - Fix count of synonym in assessment report.
    - Add list of tables created by OEM to the exclusion list.
    - Fix look at default configuration file and set mode of export_schema.sh
      to executable by default. Thanks to Kuppusamy Ravindran for the report.
    - Add AUTHORIZATION to the list of PostgreSQL reserved word. Thanks to
      Kuppusamy Ravindran for the report.
    - Display a warning when an index has the same name as the table itself so
      that you can renamed it before export. Thanks to Kuppusamy Ravindran for
      the feature request.
    - Fix export of function based indexes with multiple column. Thanks to
      Kuppusamy Ravindran for the report.
    - Modify ora2pg script to return 0 on success, 1 on any fatal error and 2
      when a child process die is detected.
    - Change the way the generic configuration file is handle during project
      initialization. You can use -c option to copy your own into the project
      directory. If the file has the .dist extension, ora2pg will apply the
      generic configuration on it. Thanks to Kuppusamy Ravindran for the report
      and features request.
    - Add debug information when cloning the Oracle connection.
    - Force return of OLD when the trigger is on DELETE event

2015 02 06 - v15.1

New minor release just to fix two annoying bugs in previous release.

    - Fix replacement of function name which include SELECT in their name by
      PERFORM. Thanks to Frederic Bamiere for the report.
    - Fix creation of sources subdirectories when initializing a new migration project.

2015 02 04 - v15.0

This major release improve PL/SQL code replacement, fixes several bugs and
adds some new useful features:

    - Add support to the PostgreSQL external_file extension to mimic BFILE
      type from Oracle. See https://github.com/darold/external_file for
      more information.
    - Allow export of Oracle's DIRECTORY as external_file extension objects
      This will also try to export read/write privilege on those directories.
    - Allow export of Oracle's DATABASE LINK as Oracle foreign data wrapper
      server using oracle_fdw.
    - Allow function with PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION to be exported through
      a dblink wrapper to achieve the autonomous transaction.
    - Allow export of Oracle's SYNONYMS as views. Views can use foreign table
      to create "synonym" on object of a remote database.
    - Add trimming of data when DATA_TYPE is used to convert CHAR(n) Oracle
      column into varchar(n) or text. Default is to trim both side any space
      character. This behavior can be controlled using two new configuration
      directives TRIM_TYPE and TRIM_CHAR.
    - Add auto detection of geometry constraint type and dimensions through
      spatial index parameters. This avoid the overhead of sequential scan
      of the geometric column.
    - Add support to export Oracle sub partition and create sub partition
      for PostgreSQL with the corresponding trigger.
    - ALLOW and EXCLUDE directives are now able to apply filter on the object
      type. Backward compatibility can not be fully preserved, older definition
      will apply to current export type only, this could change your export in
      some conditions. See documentation update for more explanation.
    - Add PACKAGE_AS_SCHEMA directive to change default behavior that use a
      schema to emulate Oracle package function call. When disable, all calls
      to package_name.function_name() will be turn into package_name_function_name()
      just like a function call in current schema.
    - Add FKEY_OPTIONS to force foreign keys options. List of supported options
      are: ON DELETE|UPDATE CASCADE|RESTRICT|NO ACTION.
    - Add rewriting of internal functions in package body, those functions will
      be prefixed by the package name. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the
      feature request.

Some change can break backward compatibility and make configuration directives
obsolete:

    - The ALLOW_PARTITION configuration directive has been removed. With new
      extended filters in ALLOW/EXCLUDE directive, this one is obsolete.
      Backward compatibility is preserved but may be removed in the future.
    - ALLOW and EXCLUDE directives do not works as previously. Backward
      compatibility may be preserved with some export type but may be broken
      in most of them. See documentation.
    - It is recommended now to leave the NLS_LANG and CLIENT_ENCODING commented
      to let Ora2Pg handle automatically the encoding. Those directives may be
      removed in the future.

Here is the full changelog of the release:

    - Declares SYNONYM views as SECURITY DEFINER to be able to grant access to
      objects in other schema.
    - Fix wrong replacement of data type in function body. Thanks to Dominique
      Legendre for the report.
    - Fix missing column name replacement on trigger export when REPLACE_COLS
      is defined. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the report.
    - Fix missing table replacement on trigger export when REPLACE_TABLES is

      column name and no values defined.
    - Allow parsing of DATABASE LINK and SYNONYM from a DDL file.
    - Add DIRECTORY export type to export all Oracle directories as entries for
      the external_file extension. This will also export read/write privilege
      on those directories. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the feature request.
    - Review documentation about NULL_EQUAL_EMPTY.
    - Fix missing code to replace IS NULL as coalesce(...). Thanks to Dominique
      Legendre for the report.
    - Add external_file schema to search_path when BFILE is set to EFILE in
      directive DATA_TYPE. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the request.
    - Remove IF EXIST clause to oracle function created by Ora2Pg for BFILE
      export. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the report.
    - Add support to the PostgreSQL external_file extension to mimic BFILE type
      from Oracle. See https://github.com/darold/external_file for more information.
    - Add auto detection of geometry constraint type and dimensions through the
      spatial index parameters first. This avoid the overhead of sequential scan
      of the geometric column.
    - Remove lookup at package function when not required.
    - Fix issue with database < 10g that do not have the DROPPED column into the
      ALL_TABLES view. Thanks to Lance Jacob for the report.
    - Add trimming of data when DATA_TYPE is used to convert CHAR(n) Oracle
      column into varchar(n) or text column into PostgreSQL. Default is to
      trim both side any whitespace character. This behavior can be controlled
      using the new configuration directives TRIM_TYPE and TRIM_CHAR.

      type. Backward compatibility can not be fully preserved, older definition
      will apply to current export type only, this could change your export in
      some conditions. See documentation update for more explanation. Thanks to
      the BRGM for the feature request.
    - Force function to be created with SECURITY DEFINER when AUTHID in table
      ALL_PROCEDURES is set to DEFINER in Oracle. This only works with Oracle

      it embeded into double quote.
    - Replace single return with return new in trigger code. Thanks to Dominique
      Legendre for the report.

2014 11 12 - v14.1

This is a maintenance release only mainly to add patches that was not
been applied in previous major release.

    - Remove ALLOW_CODE_BREAK, it is no more useful.
    - Change output of SHOW_ENCODING to reflect change to default encoding.
    - Comment ALLOW_PARTITION in default configuration file
    - Add QUERY and KETTLE export type in configuration file comments.

2014 11 05 - v14.0

This major release adds full export of Oracle Locator or Spatial geometries into
PostGis, SDO_GEOM functions and SDO_OPERATOR are also translated. This export
adds the following features:

  1. Basic and complex geometry types support
  2. Geometry data conversion from Oracle to PostGIS
  3. Spatial Index conversion
  4. Geometry metadata / constraints support
  5. Spatial functions conversion

For spatial data export, you have three choice, WKT to export data using
SDO_UTIL.TO_WKTGEOMETRY(), WKB to export data using SDO_UTIL.TO_WKBGEOMETRY()
and INTERNAL to export geometry using a Pure Perl library. Unlike the first
two methods, INTERNAL is fast and do not raise Out Of Memory. The export is
done in WKT format so that you can verify your geometry before importing to
PostgreSQL.

Other additional major features are:

  - Parallel table processing.
  - Auto generation of migration template with a complete project tree.
  - Allow user defined queries to extract data from Oracle.

Parallel table processing is controlled by the -P or --parallel command line
options or the PARALLEL_TABLE configuration directive to set the number of
tables that will be processed in parallel for data extraction. The limit is
the number of cores on your machine. Ora2Pg will the open one connection to
Oracle database for each parallel table extraction. This directive, when upper
than 1, will invalidate ORACLE_COPIES but not JOBS, so the real number of
process that will be used is (PARALLEL_TABLES * JOBS).

The two options --project_base and --init_project when used indicate to Ora2Pg
to create a project template with a work tree, a generic configuration file
and a shell script to export all objects from the Oracle database. So that you
just have to define the Oracle database connection into the configuration file
and then execute the shell script called export_schema.sh to export your
Oracle database into files. Here a sample of the command and the project's tree.

    ora2pg --project_base /tmp --init_project test_project

    /tmp/test_project/
	config/
		ora2pg.conf
	data/
	export_schema.sh
	reports/
	schema/
		fdws/  functions/  grants/  kettles/
		mviews/  packages/  partitions/
		procedures/  sequences/  tables/
		tablespaces/  triggers/  types/  views/
	sources/
		functions/  mviews/  packages/
		partitions/  procedures/  triggers/
		types/  views/

It create a generic config file where you just have to define the Oracle
database connection and a shell script called export_schema.sh. The
sources/ directory will contains the Oracle code, the schema/ will
contains the code ported to PostgreSQL. The reports/ directory will
contains the html reports with the migration cost assessment.

Sometime you may want to extract data from an Oracle table but you need a
custom query for that. Not just a "SELECT * FROM table" like Ora2Pg do but
a more complex query. The new directive REPLACE_QUERY allow you to overwrite
the query used by Ora2Pg to extract data. The format is TABLENAME[SQL_QUERY].
If you have multiple table to extract by replacing the Ora2Pg query, you can
define multiple REPLACE_QUERY lines. For example:

    REPLACE_QUERY   EMPLOYEES[SELECT e.id,e.fisrtname,lastname FROM EMPLOYEES e
	      JOIN EMP_UPDT u ON (e.id=u.id AND u.cdate>'2014-08-01 00:00:00')]

Other new features are:

    - Export of declaration of language C function. Previous version was
      not exporting function with no code body like external C function.
    - Export of COMMENT from views.
    - Function to replace some call to SYS_CONTECT(USERENV, ...) by the
      PostgreSQL equivalent.
    - Add POSTGIS_SCHEMA configuration directive to add the dedicated
      PostGis schema into the search_path.
    - Add PG_SUPPORTS_IFEXISTS configuration directive to be able to suppress
      IF EXISTS call in DDL statement generated by Ora2Pg.
    - Triggers are now all excluded/allowed following the table names specified
      in the ALLOW and EXCLUDED directives
    - Allow automatic export of nested tables (TYPE+TABLE+COPY).

One change is not fully backward compatible: Ora2Pg now use UTF8 by default
on both side. On Oracle connection NLS_LANG is set to AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8,
NLS_NCHAR to AL32UTF8. On PostgreSQL side CLIENT_ENCODING to UTF8. For export
that dump to files, Perl binmode is set to utf8. You can always change those
default setting in configuration file, but it is not recommanded.

Here is the full changelog of the release:

    - Fix inline comments into function declaration. Thanks to Marcel Huber
      for the report.
    - Fix case where SELECT ... INTO was wrongly replaced by PERFORM.

      Thanks to menardorama for the feature request.
    - Add PARALLEL_TABLES configuration directive to force ora2Pg to use on
      process and one connection per table up to the number of CPU specified.

    - Exclude dropped tables (those who are in the recycle bin) from export.
    - When USER_GRANTS is disabled, aka login as dba user, force table list to
      be checked against DBA_SEGMENTS with SEGMENT_TYPE of type table or table
      partition. This could help solving some incomprehensible object found in
      Oracle view ALL_TABLES.
    - Fix query to retrieved list of tables, owner selection was set two time.
    - Add support to automatic nested table export (TYPE+TABLE+COPY).
    - Fix wrong export of materialized view log table. Thanks to Ronson Blossom
      for the report.

      are converted into x IS NULL. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the report.
    - Add warning at exit to signal when a OOM occurs. In that case, when a child
      Ora2Pg process was silently killed by the OOM killer there was no information
      that a failure occurs.

2014 06 02 - v13.0

This major release adds first support to export Oracle Spatial Objects to PostGis
Spatial objects. There's also a new configuration directive to allow logging of
statement failures to prevent Ora2Pg to abort and continue to load valid data. 
The other main feature is the possibility to convert DDL files without needing an
Oracle database connection, until now this was reserved to files containing stored
procedures. There's also several bug fixes.

	- Allow error logging during data import. This feature controlled by the
	  LOG_ON_ERROR directive allow you to not abort the data import process
	  when an error is encountered and to log to a file the COPY or INSERT
	  statement that generate the error. After fixing the statement you will
	  be able to load the missing data. Thanks to menardoram for the feature
	  request.
	- Force export type to be INSERT when COPY is used and a table have a
	  GEOMETRY column. I can not find a solution to export as copy statement
	  for the moment. Thanks to Dominique Legendre and Vincent Picavet for
	  the help.
	- Fix export of user defined type as object. Thanks to Shanshan Wang for
	  the report.
	- Limit look up of objects to the ALLOW or EXCLUDE filter into the SQL
	  query instead of the Perl code to avoid retrieving huge list of objects
	  on such database. Thanks to menardorama for the feature request.
	- Add support to spatial data export in INSERT mode. Still need some work
	  in COPY export mode if possible.
	- Fix query to retrieve SRID that broken with patch on CONVERT_SRID.
	- Fix wrong filter with ALLOW directive when getting list of  partition.
	- Add GRANT export read from an input file.
	- Fix data type conversion when using input file and data type such
	  varchar2(10 BYTE).
	- Add export of comment with TABLE and VIEW exports using an input file.
	- Add extraction of TABLESPACE from an input file.
	- Add support to SEQUENCE extraction from input file.
	- Fix wrong filter with ALLOW directive when exporting partition. The
	  filter was done on partition name instead of table name, that mean
	  that setting ALLOW directive was resulting in no export at all. Thanks
	  to menardorama for the report.
	- Add CONVERT_SRID configuration directive to control the automatic
	  conversion of SRID to standard EPSG using the Oracle SDO function
	  sdo_cs.map_oracle_srid_to_epsg() Oracle function. Thanks to Dominique
	  Legendre for the help.
	- Fix a typo in the create index prefix on partitioned tables. Thanks
	  to menardorama for the patch.
	- Fix non replacement of destination during SHOW_COLUMN and COPY export.
	  Using MODIFY_TYPE was only working in TABLE export.
	- Force pl/sql conversion with TABLE export to replace advanced default
	  values. Fix code TRUNC(SYSDATE, MONTH) in default value and everywhere
	  that should be: date_trunc(month,LOCALTIMESTAMP). Thanks to menardorama
	  for the report.
	- Fix code regarding unique partition index naming. Thanks to menardorama
	  for the report.
	- Add PREFIX_PARTITION configuration directive. When enabled it will force
	  renaming all partition table name with the name of the parent table.
	  Thanks to menardoram for the feature request.
	- Add AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE in configuration file and documentation
	  about this new directive.
	- Add export of SDO_GEOMETRY column type. They are basically exported to
	  the non-constrained "geometry" type with SRID if defined. When the
	  configuration directive AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE is enable, Ora2Pg will
	  try to autodetect the geometry type, the dimension and the SRID used
	  to set a constrained geometry type. For example, in the first case
	  column shape with Oracle type SDO_GEOMETRY will be converted as:

		shape geometry(GEOMETRY) or shape geometry(GEOMETRY, 4326)

	  and in the second case, with constrained geometry type:

		shape geometry(POLIGONZ, 4326)

	  with a three dimensional polygon. Thanks to Vincent Picavet for the
	  feature request and specification.
	- Add support to spatial index read from file.
	- Add export of Oracle spatial index. For example, index:
		CREATE INDEX cola_spatial_idx ON cola_markets(shape) INDEXTYPE IS MDSYS.SPATIAL_INDEX;
	  will be exported as
		CREATE INDEX cola_spatial_idx ON cola_markets USING GIST(shape);
	  Thanks to Vincent Picavet / Oslandia for the feature request and explanations.
	- Allow TRIGGER export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Add PG_SUPPORTS_CHECKOPTION configuration directive to not remove
	  WITH CHECK OPTION in create view statement. It is supported in 
	  PostgreSQL 9.4.
	- Allow VIEW export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Allow TABLE export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Add SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT configuration directive disabled by default.
	  This is the current behavior of Ora2Pg, it set synchronous_commit
	  to off before data import to PostgreSQL. This is only used when you
	  load data directly to PostgreSQL, the default is off to disable
	  synchronous commit to gain speed at writing data. Some modified or
	  old version of PostgreSQL, like Greenplum, do not have this setting.
	- Add some useful information for Windows user in documentation. Thanks
	  to Roger Park for the report.
	- Fix case when parentheses are omitted in index creation. Thanks to
	  Yuri Ushakov for the report.
	- Fix export type PACKAGE when ALLOW is defined to extract only some
	  packages. Thanks to Maciej Bak for the report.
	- Fix INSERT export where backslash should be escaped and single be
	  doubled in standard conforming string notation. Thanks to Yuri
	  Ushakov for the report.
	- Add important note about LONGREADLEN and DATA_LIMIT that could need
	  to be adjusted to avoid out of memory. Thanks to Mike Kienenberger
	  for the patch.
	- Fix case sensitivity issue with export of comment on column. Thanks
	  to Pierre Crumeyrolle for the report.
	- Fix export of RAW data in COPY mode, was missing a backslash. Thanks
	  to jwiechmann for the report.
	- Fix RAW data export in COPY and INSERT mode, RAW data type is returned
	  in hex by DBD::Oracle. Thanks to jwiechmann for the report.
	- Fix one release 8i condition.
	- Fix inexistent column USE_NO_INDEX with Oracle 8i and MVIEW export.
	- Enclose call to utf8::encode and utf8::valid into eval.
	- Fix export of constraint with Oracle 8i release.
	- Fix unrecognized fatal error with 8i database. Thanks to UnvorherSeba
	  for the patch.
	- Revert change level of error from fatal to error, when querying
	  materialized view.
	- Change level of error from fatal to error, when querying materialized
	  view.

2014 01 28 - v12.1

This is a maintenance release with some minor bug fixes and a new configuration
directive, INDEXES_SUFFIX, to allow appending a suffix to indexes names.

	- Fix example given for the WHERE configuration directive. Thanks to
	  Bob Treumann for the report.
	- Add INDEXES_SUFFIX configuration option to allow append a suffix to
	  indexes names.
	- Replace special charater ^M by \r as they are not supported by git.
	- Fix IF EXISTS in alter table of sub _drop_foreign_keys. Thanks to
	  Francis Corriveau for the patch.
	- Fix isolation level when exporting data. Thanks to Ludovic Penet for
	  the report.
	- Fix regression when ora2pg tries to create foreign keys on tables or
	  to tables that are not selected for export. Thanks to Ludovic Penet.
	- Add information about backslashed comma into directive MODIFY_TYPE
	  into Makefile.PL.
	- Add missing MODIFY_TYPE definition in documentation.
	- Allow backslashed comma into MODIFY_TYPE type redefinition. Example:
		TABLE1:COL3:decimal(9\,6),TABLE1:COL4:decimal(9\,6).
	  Thanks to Mike Kienenberger for the report
	- Fix missing single cote into create_materialized_view() call. Thanks
	  to Jacky Rigoreau for the patch.
	- Fix some typo in documentation, thanks to Mike Kienenberger for the
	  report.
	- Add a chapter about installing DBD::Oracle into documentation. Thanks
	  to Raghavendra for the patch.
	- Fix case sensitivity on external table name with FDW export type.
	  Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix export of materialized views when PG_SUPPORTS_MVIEW is disabled.
	  Thanks to Christian Bjornbak for the report.
	- Update copyright.

2013 10 22 - v12.0

This release fixes lot of issues and three new features. Using REORDERING_COLUMNS
directive you will be able to reorder columns to minimized the footprint on disc,
so that more rows fit on a data page. The PG_SUPPORTS_MVIEW will allow you to
export materialized with native PostgreSQL 9.3 syntaxe. The USE_TABLESPACE variable
will allow you to export object using their original tablespace.

	- Skip constraints on system internal columns (sys_nc...$) from export.
	- Fix missing output directory in generic psql file for data loading.
	- Add missing progress bar during TYPE and PARTITION export type.
	- Remove duplicated message in debug mode during Oracle reconnection.
	- Allow file input with create type declaration to use ora2pg converter.
	  Unsupported syntax is signaled into the output file.
	- Exclude MLOG$.* and RUPD$.* table from export.
	- Prevent export of indexes and constraints during FDW export type.
	- Fix wrong total number of sequences shown in progress bar.
	- Remove warning when PG_DSN is define during a export type that do not
	  support direct import into PostgreSQL.
	- Auto switch prefix from DBA to ALL when error 942 is returned when
	  looking at tables informations. A hint is also displayed to ask for
	  activating USER_GRANTS or connect using a user with DBA privilege.

was not addressed in previous release, please upgrade.

	- Fix other major issues in migration cost assessment.
	- Redefine some migration cost values to be more precise.

2013 05 27 - v11.3

This release fixes several major issues on migration cost assessment, especialy
with stored procedures with lot of lines or if you have lot of comments in that
code. You may want to run your database evaluation again as the estimated times
can be up to tree time lower on huge PL/SQL code.

	  "ora2pg logger" for the progress bar, "ora2pg - querying Oracle" when
	  used with -J option and "ora2pg - sending to PostgreSQL" to better
	  know  what is the current job of the process.
	- Removed the use of /Y flag in Windows install script, this was causing
	  error "dmake:  Error code 130, while making install_all". Thanks to
	  Jean-Marc Adingra for the report.

This release adds partition data speed improvement by exporting data directly
from and into the destination partitioned table. There's also some bug fix on
RAW or LONG RAW data export and PL/SQL to PL/PGSQL code rewrite.

	- Adjust cost assessment for indexes, tables and tables partition.
	- Add comment to report of index partition about local index only.
	- Fix position of TRUNCATE TABLE in output file.

	  as hex string. Now data are converted using utl_raw.cast_to_varchar2()
	  function before being escaped for insert into a bytea. Thanks to Alex
	  Delianis for the report.
	- Fix issue with Oracle TIMESTAMP(0) data export that add a single
	  ending point, ex: "2008-08-09 00:00:00.", this ending character is
	  now removed by format_data_type(). Thanks to Pierre-Marie Petit for
	  the report.
	- Fix typo on MODIFY_STRUCT description.

	  tables instead of inserted into the main table and dispatched by the
	  trigger. Ora2Pg will automatically detect the in/out table partition,
	  there's nothing to configure.
	- PL/SQL: Do not allow decode() rewrite by case/when/else when there
	  is a function call in it.

2012 12 12 - v10.0

This is the first version of Ora2Pg 10.x series, that is a major release.
Overall numerous improvements and bugs fixes there's now a new export type:
SHOW_REPORT that will output a report of all objects contained in your Oracle
database and some comments on how they will be exported. With this report you
can use a new directive ESTIMATE_COST to ask to Ora2Pg to evaluate the database
migration cost in terms of man days. There's also an other new configuration
directive EXTERNAL_TO_FDW, disable by default, to permit the export of all
Oracle external tables as file_fdw foreign tables.

The database content report and the migration cost estimation is a work in
progress so all feedback on these new features are welcome. Here is the complete
changelog:

	- Update documentation about ora2pg usage and new feature.
	- Fix quote escaping on table comments. Thanks to Sebastian Fischer.

	  value. Note that this is the first time that Ora2Pg need write access
	  to the Oracle database, if you do not have BFILE or you have set the
	  corresponding PostgreSQL type asd bytea (the default) the function
	  will not be created.

UPGRADE: Ora2Pg.pm and ora2pg perl scripts have changed as well as configuration
file. Documentation has been updated too so you'd better install all again.

2012 04 30 - 8.11

	- Fix an error when running ora2pg directly against PG, index and
	  constraints are created against PG instead of being written to
	  the output file. Thanks to David Greco for the report.
	- Ora2Pg will now output a warning message when direct import to PG
	  is set with other import type than COPY and DATA.
	- Fix NUL character removing on LOB to bytea export. Thanks to info31
	  on PostgresqlFr for the report.

2012 03 11 - 8.10

	- Add two configuration directives to control the BLOB export.
	  LONGREADLEN to set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute
	  to a value that will be the larger than the expected size of the
	  LOB. LONGTRUNKOK to bypass the 'ORA-24345: A Truncation' error.
	  Thanks to Dirk Treger for the report.
	- Fix install problem on non-threaded Perl and the threads package.
	  Replace use() by require() call. Thanks to Ian Sillitoe for the patch.
	- Fix strange Oracle behaviour where binary_double infinity is exported

	  report.

UPGRADE: only Ora2Pg.pm have changed so you can just override it. See also
documentation for new configuration directives: LONGREADLEN and LONGTRUNKOK.
	
2011 11 07 - 8.9

	- Fix double quote into file name of package function export when case
	  sensitivity is preserved.
	- Add support to XMLType data extraction. Thanks to Aaron Culich for
	  the report. Before this release, xml data was exported as a Perl
	  array reference.
	- Fix bug during foreign key export when foreign keys have different
	  owners. Thanks to Krasi Zlatev for the patch.
	- Add support to plpgsql conversion during index extraction as many
	  index use some Oracle function on their declaration. Thanks to
	  Sriram Chandrasekaran fot the feature request.
	- PLSQL: Add replacement of Oracle subtr() by PostgreSQL substring().
	  Thanks to Sriram Chandrasekaran fot the feature request.
	- PLSQL: Add replacement of Oracle decode() by PostgreSQL CASE/THEN/ELSE.
	  Thanks to Sriram Chandrasekaran fot the feature request.
	  Note that this two replacement was not implemented because they could
	  break the code if there's complex subqueries inside their declaration.
	  This is why you can enable it by setting ALLOW_CODE_BREAK to 1 (new).
	  In later release this directive will be enable by default.
	- Add output ordering on some object name so that results between two
	  runs can be compared. Thanks to Henk Enting for the patch.
	- Fix misshandling of all cases of RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR rewrite into
	  RAISE EXCEPTION concatenations. Thanks to Krasi Zlatev for the report.

UPGRADE: only Ora2Pg.pm and Ora2Pg/PSQL.pm have changed so you can just override them
if you dont want to reinstall all.

2011 10 13 - 8.8

	- Before that release when you upgraded Ora2Pg using Makefile, the old
	  ora2pg.conf was renamed as ora2pg.old. This can lead to lost previous
	  configuration, the old ora2pg.conf is now untouched and the new one is
	  installed as ora2pg.conf.new.
	- Renamed ora2pg.pl into ora2pg_pl in the package before installation
	  to avoid the copy of the perl script into the site Perl install dir.
	  It is still installed as ora2pg in /usr/local/bin by default.
	- Fix errors that appeared to be due to no quoting on the field names
	  when ORA_SENSITIVE is enabled. Thank to Sam Nelson for the patch.
	- Limit case sensitivity on check constraints to column names only,
	  before that if there was a value between double quote into the check
	  constraint, it was wrongly changed to lower case.
	- Fix broken case sensitivity at data export when disabling/enabling
	  triggers and truncating tables with copy or insert statement.
	- Change Ora2Pg version in packaging files that was still in 8.5.

UPGRADE: only Ora2Pg.pm have changed so you can just override it.

2011 09 07 - 8.7

	- The escape_bytea() function has been rewritten using a prebuild array
	  to gain twice of performances. Thanks to Marc Cousin from Dalibo for
	  the patch.
	- Improve speed of bulkload data by disabling autocommit by issuing a
	  BEGIN at the start and COMMIT at the end.
	- Add multi-threading support. It is only used to do the escaping to
	  convert LOBs to byteas, as it is very cpu hungry. There's a lot of
	  CPU-waste here. The threads number is controlled by a new configuration
	  directive: THREAD_COUNT. Putting 6 threads will only triple your
	  throughput, if your machine has enough cores. If zero (default value),
	  do not use threads, do not waste CPU, but be slower with bytea.
	  Performance seems to peak at 5 threads, if you have enough cores, and
	  triples throughput on tables having LOB. Another important thing:
	  because of the way threading works in perl, threads consume a lot of
	  memory. Put a low (5000 for instance) DATA_LIMIT if you activate
	  threading. Many thanks to Marc Cousin for this great patch.
	- Fix standard_conforming_string usage on export as INSERT statement.
	- Fix an issue with importing Oracle NULL character (\0 or char(0)) with
	  bytea and character data with UTF8 encoding. Now whatever is the data
	  type or the encoding, this character is simply removed to prevent the
	  well known 'ERROR: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0x00.'
	  Thanks to Jean-Paul Argudo from Dalibo for the report.
	- Fix an incorrect syntax for "for each statement" triggers.
	  Thanks to Henk Enting for the report.
	- Add comment at end of line to signal on which cursor the replacement
	  on " EXIT WHEN (...)%NOTFOUND " is done. This will return something 
	  like "IF NOT FOUND THEN EXIT; END IF; -- apply on $1". Thanks to
	  jehan Guillaume De Rorthais from Dalibo for the report this help a lot
	  during Pl/Pgsql code review.
	- Fix table/column name replacement on constraint creation and dropping
	  when REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS is set during DATA/COPY export.
	- Fix table/column name replacement on indexes creation and dropping
	  when REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS is set during DATA/COPY export.
	- Remove unused table name parameter in _drop_indexes() function.
	- Add support to REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS during schema export.
	  Before this release those replacements were only applied to DATA or
	  COPY export. You can now use it in schema export, it will replace
	  table and/or column names in the TABLE/INDEX/CONSTRAINT schema export.
	  MODIFY_STRUCT is still limited to DATA or COPY export as it have no
	  sense outside this export. Unfortunately those replacements can not be
	  done easilly in other export type like TRIGGER, FUNCTION, etc. so you
	  must still edit this code by hand.
	- Use the bundled Perl Config module to detect if Perl is compiled with
	  useithread. This mean that the old local defined %Config hash has been
	  replaced by %AConfig.
	- SKIP indices is now obsolete and must be replaced with SKIP indexes.
	  backward compatibility is preserved.
	- The file generated when FILE_PER_INDEX is activated has been renamed
	  into INDEXES_... instead of INDICES_...
	- Add a warning on tablespace export when Oracle user is not a dba.
	- Fix fatal error when dumping to one file per function with double
	  directory output.
	- Fix double print of FATAL messages and dirty database disconnect on
	  fatal errors.
	- Add setting of client_encoding into each export type as defined in
	  the configuration file.
	- Update web site documentation.

UPGRADE: Ora2Pg.pm, Ora2Pg/PGSQL.pm and ora2pg have changed so they must be
overwritten.  There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation
has changed as well. Backward compatibility is fully preserved.


2011 07 07 - 8.6

	- Remove "use strict" from head of Ora2Pg.pm that breaks view export.
	  This is usually removed before public release, but not this time.
	  Thanks to Jehan Guillaume de Rorthais from Dalibo for the report.
	- Add a new configuration directive called COMPILE_SCHEMA that force
	  Oracle to compile the PL/SQL before code extraction to validate
	  code that was invalidate for any reason before. If you set it to 1,
	  you will force compiling of the user session schema, but you can
	  specify the name of the schema to compile as the value too. Thanks
	  to Jean-Paul Argudo from Dalibo for the solution.
	- Add new configuration directive EXPORT_INVALID to allow export of all
	  PL/SQL code even if it is marked as invalid status. The 'VALID' or 
	  'INVALID' status applies to functions, procedures, packages and user
	  defined types.
	- Excluded from export all tables, types, views, functions and packages
	  that contains a $ character. Most of the time they don't need to be
	  exported.
	- PLSQL: add automatic conversion of Oracle SYS_REFURSOR as PostgreSQL
	  REFCURSOR.
	- Rewrite entirely the parser of DBMS_OUTPUT du to concatenation errors.
	- PLSQL: add automatic replacement of some Oracle exception errors:
          INVALID_CURSOR=>INVALID_CURSOR_STATE, ZERO_DIVIDE=>DIVISION_BY_ZERO,
          STORAGE_ERROR=>OUT_OF_MEMORY.

UPGRADE: Ora2Pg.pm and Ora2Pg/PGSQL.pm have changed so they must be overwritten.
There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation has changed as
well. Backward compatibility is fully preserved.


2011 07 01 - 8.5

	- When FILE_PER_FUNCTION is activated and export type is PACKAGE, Ora2Pg
	  will now save all functions/procedures of a package body into a
	  directory named as the package name and into different files. This
	  will allow to load each function separatly or load them all with the
	  OUTPUT SQL script generated by Ora2Pg.
	- Fix Oracle package body parsing failure when a procedure is declared
	  inside an other.
	- Add new configuration options FILE_PER_CONSTRAINT and FILE_PER_INDEX
	  to generate three files during the schema extraction. One for the
	  'CREATE TABLE' statements, one for the constraints (primary keys,
	  foreign keys, etc.) and the last one for indices. Thanks to Daniel
	  Scott for the feature request.
	- Allow to process PL/SQL Oracle code from file instead of a database
	  to apply Ora2Pg code conversion. Thank to Mindy Markowitz for the
	  feature request. See -i or --input_file command line option to ora2pg
	  perl script or INPUT_FILE new configuration option.
	- Add new configuration directive STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS that is
	  used only during DATA export type to build INSERT statements. This
	  should avoid 'WARNING:  nonstandard use of \\ in a string literal'.
	  Please check that this behavior is backward compatible with your
	  PostgreSQL usage as this is enabled by default now.

UPGRADE: The new features has changed Ora2Pg.pm and ora2pg.pl so that they must
be overwritten. There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation
has changed as well. Take care of backward compatibility with escaped strings in
DATA export type and the new behavior on PACKAGE export. 

2011 06 07 - 8.4

	- Moves Ora2Pg to SourceForge.net.
	- Fix an issue on setting owner in "ALTER SEQUENCE ... SET OWNER TO".
	  Thanks to Herve Girres for the report.
	- Bugfix on lower case convertion for check constraints extraction.
	  Thanks to Alexander Korotkov for the patch.

UPGRADE: There's no new functionality, this is a bug fix release.

2011 05 11 - 8.3

	- Fix issue on inherited user defined types converted to inherited tables.
	  Add comment on unsupported inherited type in PostgreSQL too. Thanks to
	  Mathieu Wingel for the report.
	- Fix issue on column default values. Oracle all this kind of strange
	  syntax: counter NUMBER(4) default '' not null, that was translated to
	  counter smallint DEFAULT '' by Ora2Pg. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel this is
	  now rewritten as DEFAULT NOT NULL.
	- Fix case sensitivity on create view when there was double quote on the
	  column name statement part. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel or the report.
	- Fix bad patch applied on column name case sensitivity issue during check
	  constraint export. Thanks to Philippe Rimbault for the report.
	- Fix bug on package export introduced into version v8.2. The issue was
	  related to end of package procedure detection. hanks to Mathieu Wingel
	  or the report.

UPGRADE: There's no new functionality, this is a bug fix release and every one
should upgrade to it.


2011 05 01 - 8.2

	- PLSQL: automatic replacement of EXIT WHEN cursor%NOTFOUND; by Pg
	  synthax: IF NOT FOUND THEN EXIT; END IF;. Works with additional
	  condition too.
	- PLSQL: Automatic replacement of SQL%NOTFOUND by NOT FOUND.
	- PLSQL: Add detection of TOO_MANY_ROW to NO_DATA_FOUND to add STRICT.
	- Completely rewrite the parsing of Oracle package body to handle all
	  cases and especially prodedure declared into an other procedure.
	  Those procedure are renamed INTERNAL_FUNCTION and must be rewritten.
	- Fix type usage of ora2pg Perl script.
	- Add a new directive FORCE_OWNER. By default the owner of the database
	  objects is the one you're using to connect to PostgreSQL. If you use
	  an other user (postgres for exemple) you can force Ora2Pg to set the
	  object owner to be the one used in the Oracle database by setting the
	  directive to 1, or to a completely different username by setting the
	  directive value to that username. Thanks to Herve Girres from Meteo
	  France for the suggestion and patch.
	- Add --forceowner or -f command line option to ora2pg program.
	- Add SHOW_ENCODING extract type to return the Oracle session encoding.
	  For example it can return: NLS_LANG AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8 
	- Remove SYS_EXTRACT_UTC from index creation as Pg always stores them
	  in UTC. Thanks to Daniel Scott for the patch.
	- In PLSQL code SYS_EXTRACT_UTC is replaced by the Pg syntaxe:
	  field AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'.
	- Fix a pending problem with "Wide character in print at" on COPY mode.
	  Thanks to Bernd Helmle from Credativ GmbH for the patch.
	- PLSQL: Add automatic rewrite of FOR ... IN REVERSE ... into Pg synthax
	- Fix column name case sensitivity issue during check constraint export.
	  Thanks to Daniel Berger for the report.
	- Remove the possibility to add comment after a configuration directive
	  it may not be used and it was generating an issue with the passwords
	  configuration directives for examples. Thanks to Daniel Berger for the
	  report.
	- Complete rewrite of user defined type extraction. Add support of inherited
	  type using Oracle UNDER keyword as well as better support to custom type
	  with BODY. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel for the report.
	- Fix case sensitivity on user defined types. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel for
	  the report.

UPGRADE: All files have changed so you need a fresh install/upgrade.
Previous release used to remove any string starting from a # in the config file,
this was to allow comments after a configuration directive. This possibility
have been removed in this release so you can no more add comments after a
configuration directive.


2011 03 28 - 8.1

	- Prevent Ora2PG to export twice datas when using FILE_PER_TABLE and
	  the data output file exist. This is useful in case of export failure
	  and you don't want to export all data again. This also mean that if
	  you want to get new data you have to remove the old files before.
	- Fix parsing of procedure/function into pl/sql Oracle package.
	- Fix bug in IS NULL/IS NOT NULL replacement. Thanks to Jean-Paul Argudo
	  from Dalibo for the report.
	- Add CREATE OR REPLACE on RULE creation.
	- Add DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS before trigger creation.
	- Replace Oracle date "0000-00-00" by NULL.
	- Fix infinite loop in package/fonction type replacement.
	- Add one file per package creation if FILE_PER_FUNCTION is enabled.
	- Fix double quote in name of custom type extraction.
	- Add extraction of custom type IS VARRAY as an custom type of table
	  array. Thank to Jean-Paul Argudo from Dalibo for the patch.
	- Fix multiple double quote in name of create index definition.
	- Apply excluded and limited table to tablespace extraction.
	- Fix function and procedure detection/parsing on package content.
	- Fix schema prefix in function name declaration in package export. 
	- PLSQL: Replace some way of extracting date part of a date :
	  TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(...)) rewritten into TO_CHAR(...)::integer when
	  TO_NUMBER just have one argument.
	- Fix Makefile.pl error when trying to modify file ora2pg now renamed
	  into ora2pg.pl
	- Add 3 new export types SHOW_SCHEMA, SHOW_TABLE and SHOW_COLUMN. Those
	  new extraction keyword are use to only display the requested information
	  and exit. This allow you to quickly know on what you are going to work.
	  The SHOW_COLUMN allow a new ora2pg command line option: '--xtable relname'
	  or '-x relname' to limit the displayed information to the given table.
	- Add type replacement for BINARY_INTEGER and PLS_INTEGER as integer.

UPGRADE: Please make a full upgrade asap to this release.

2011 03 15 - 8.0

	  before the import and recreate them and the end of the import. This may
	  help if DEFER_FKEY not works for you.
	- Add DROP_INDEX configuration directive to force deletion of all indexes
	  except the automatic index (primary keys) before data import and to
	  recreate them at end. This can be used to gain speed during import.

	- Modify ora2pg.pl to simplify it. Reading configuration is now done
	internally by Ora2Pg.pm as well as all other initialization process.
	You can always overwrite all configuration options into call to new
	Ora2Pg(). Now ora2pg.pl can be as simple as:

		use Ora2Pg;
		my $schema = new Ora2Pg('config' => "/etc/ora2pg.conf");
		$schema->export_schema();
		exit(0);

	This will be less confusing. You can upgrade Ora2Pg.pm without carring

	if only one OUT parameter, return his type. If no out parameter: return
	VOID. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Fix export DATA when the name of a column in the table match COMMENT,
	AUDIT or any other defined reserved words. These reserved words are

	  view into a Pg table. There's nothing special to do, just to give
	  the view name into the TABLES configuration directive and set TYPE
	  to DATA or COPY. If views are not specified in the TABLES directive
	  there's not view export but only table data.
	- Add capability to extract views structure as table schema. There's
	  nothing special to do, just to give the view name into the TABLES
	  configuration directive and set TYPE to TABLE. This will not extract
