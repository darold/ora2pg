2014 06 02 - v13.0

This major release adds first support to export Oracle Spatial Objects to PostGis
Spatial objects. There's also a new configuration directive to allow logging of
statement failures to prevent Ora2Pg to abort and continue to load valid data. 
The other main feature is the possibility to convert DDL files without needing an
Oracle database connection, until now this was reserved to files containing stored
procedures. There's also several bug fixes.

	- Allow error logging during data import. This feature controlled by the
	  LOG_ON_ERROR directive allow you to not abort the data import process
	  when an error is encountered and to log to a file the COPY or INSERT
	  statement that generate the error. After fixing the statement you will
	  be able to load the missing data. Thanks to menardoram for the feature
	  request.
	- Force export type to be INSERT when COPY is used and a table have a
	  GEOMETRY column. I can not find a solution to export as copy statement
	  for the moment. Thanks to Dominique Legendre and Vincent Picavet for
	  the help.
	- Fix export of user defined type as object. Thanks to Shanshan Wang for
	  the report.
	- Limit look up of objects to the ALLOW or EXCLUDE filter into the SQL
	  query instead of the Perl code to avoid retrieving huge list of objects
	  on such database. Thanks to menardorama for the feature request.
	- Add support to spatial data export in INSERT mode. Still need some work
	  in COPY export mode if possible.
	- Fix query to retrieve SRID that broken with patch on CONVERT_SRID.
	- Fix wrong filter with ALLOW directive when getting list of  partition.
	- Add GRANT export read from an input file.
	- Fix data type conversion when using input file and data type such
	  varchar2(10 BYTE).
	- Add export of comment with TABLE and VIEW exports using an input file.
	- Add extraction of TABLESPACE from an input file.
	- Add support to SEQUENCE extraction from input file.
	- Fix wrong filter with ALLOW directive when exporting partition. The
	  filter was done on partition name instead of table name, that mean
	  that setting ALLOW directive was resulting in no export at all. Thanks
	  to menardorama for the report.
	- Add CONVERT_SRID configuration directive to control the automatic
	  conversion of SRID to standard EPSG using the Oracle SDO function
	  sdo_cs.map_oracle_srid_to_epsg() Oracle function. Thanks to Dominique
	  Legendre for the help.
	- Fix a typo in the create index prefix on partitioned tables. Thanks
	  to menardorama for the patch.
	- Fix non replacement of destination during SHOW_COLUMN and COPY export.
	  Using MODIFY_TYPE was only working in TABLE export.
	- Force pl/sql conversion with TABLE export to replace advanced default
	  values. Fix code TRUNC(SYSDATE, MONTH) in default value and everywhere
	  that should be: date_trunc(month,LOCALTIMESTAMP). Thanks to menardorama
	  for the report.
	- Fix code regarding unique partition index naming. Thanks to menardorama
	  for the report.
	- Add PREFIX_PARTITION configuration directive. When enabled it will force
	  renaming all partition table name with the name of the parent table.
	  Thanks to menardoram for the feature request.
	- Add AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE in configuration file and documentation
	  about this new directive.
	- Add export of SDO_GEOMETRY column type. They are basically exported to
	  the non-constrained "geometry" type with SRID if defined. When the
	  configuration directive AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE is enable, Ora2Pg will
	  try to autodetect the geometry type, the dimension and the SRID used
	  to set a constrained geometry type. For example, in the first case
	  column shape with Oracle type SDO_GEOMETRY will be converted as:

		shape geometry(GEOMETRY) or shape geometry(GEOMETRY, 4326)

	  and in the second case, with constrained geometry type:

		shape geometry(POLIGONZ, 4326)

	  with a three dimensional polygon. Thanks to Vincent Picavet for the
	  feature request and specification.
	- Add support to spatial index read from file.
	- Add export of Oracle spatial index. For example, index:
		CREATE INDEX cola_spatial_idx ON cola_markets(shape) INDEXTYPE IS MDSYS.SPATIAL_INDEX;
	  will be exported as
		CREATE INDEX cola_spatial_idx ON cola_markets USING GIST(shape);
	  Thanks to Vincent Picavet / Oslandia for the feature request and explanations.
	- Allow TRIGGER export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Add PG_SUPPORTS_CHECKOPTION configuration directive to not remove
	  WITH CHECK OPTION in create view statement. It is supported in 
	  PostgreSQL 9.4.
	- Allow VIEW export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Allow TABLE export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Add SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT configuration directive disabled by default.
	  This is the current behavior of Ora2Pg, it set synchronous_commit
	  to off before data import to PostgreSQL. This is only used when you
	  load data directly to PostgreSQL, the default is off to disable
	  synchronous commit to gain speed at writing data. Some modified or
	  old version of PostgreSQL, like Greenplum, do not have this setting.
	- Add some useful information for Windows user in documentation. Thanks
	  to Roger Park for the report.
	- Fix case when parentheses are omitted in index creation. Thanks to
	  Yuri Ushakov for the report.
	- Fix export type PACKAGE when ALLOW is defined to extract only some
	  packages. Thanks to Maciej Bak for the report.
	- Fix INSERT export where backslash should be escaped and single be
	  doubled in standard conforming string notation. Thanks to Yuri
	  Ushakov for the report.
	- Add important note about LONGREADLEN and DATA_LIMIT that could need
	  to be adjusted to avoid out of memory. Thanks to Mike Kienenberger
	  for the patch.
	- Fix case sensitivity issue with export of comment on column. Thanks
	  to Pierre Crumeyrolle for the report.
	- Fix export of RAW data in COPY mode, was missing a backslash. Thanks
	  to jwiechmann for the report.
	- Fix RAW data export in COPY and INSERT mode, RAW data type is returned
	  in hex by DBD::Oracle. Thanks to jwiechmann for the report.
	- Fix one release 8i condition.
	- Fix inexistent column USE_NO_INDEX with Oracle 8i and MVIEW export.
	- Enclose call to utf8::encode and utf8::valid into eval.
	- Fix export of constraint with Oracle 8i release.
	- Fix unrecognized fatal error with 8i database. Thanks to UnvorherSeba
	  for the patch.
	- Revert change level of error from fatal to error, when querying
	  materialized view.
	- Change level of error from fatal to error, when querying materialized
	  view.

2014 01 28 - v12.1

	  Bob Treumann for the report.
	- Add INDEXES_SUFFIX configuration option to allow append a suffix to
	  indexes names.
	- Replace special charater ^M by \r as they are not supported by git.

	  Francis Corriveau for the patch.
	- Fix isolation level when exporting data. Thanks to Ludovic Penet for
	  the report.
	- Fix regression when ora2pg tries to create foreign keys on tables or
	  to tables that are not selected for export. Thanks to Ludovic Penet.
	- Add information about backslashed comma into directive MODIFY_TYPE
	  into Makefile.PL.

	- Redefine some migration cost values to be more precise.

2013 05 27 - v11.3

This release fixes several major issues on migration cost assessment, especialy
with stored procedures with lot of lines or if you have lot of comments in that
code. You may want to run your database evaluation again as the estimated times
can be up to tree time lower on huge PL/SQL code. 

	- Add full details about PL/SQL evaluation by ora2pg when --estimate_cost
	  or ESTIMATE_COST is enable. This will display cost units per keywords
	  detected in the function/package code.

	  "ora2pg logger" for the progress bar, "ora2pg - querying Oracle" when
	  used with -J option and "ora2pg - sending to PostgreSQL" to better
	  know  what is the current job of the process.
	- Removed the use of /Y flag in Windows install script, this was causing
	  error "dmake:  Error code 130, while making install_all". Thanks to

UPGRADE: please reinstall all as most of the files have changed.

2013 04 07 - v11.1

This release adds partition data speed improvement by exporting data directly
from and into the destination partitioned table. There's also some bug fix on
RAW or LONG RAW data export and PL/SQL to PL/PGSQL code rewrite.

	- Adjust cost assessment for indexes, tables and tables partition.
	- Add comment to report of index partition about local index only.
	- Fix position of TRUNCATE TABLE in output file.
	- Fix export of data from RAW or LONG RAW columns, they was exported
	  as hex string. Now data are converted using utl_raw.cast_to_varchar2()
	  function before being escaped for insert into a bytea. Thanks to Alex
	  Delianis for the report.
	- Fix issue with Oracle TIMESTAMP(0) data export that add a single
	  ending point, ex: "2008-08-09 00:00:00.", this ending character is
	  now removed by format_data_type(). Thanks to Pierre-Marie Petit for
	  the report.
	- Fix typo on MODIFY_STRUCT description.
	- Force DEBUG to off in default configuration file.
	- Change range PARTITION operators in the check conditions, >= and <
	  replaced by > and <=, corresponding to Oracle VALUES LESS THAN.

	- PLSQL: Fix wrong replacement of SELECT by PERFORM during VIEW export.
	- Partitioned tables data is now imported directly into the destination
	  tables instead of inserted into the main table and dispatched by the
	  trigger. Ora2Pg will automatically detect the in/out table partition,
	  there's nothing to configure.
	- PL/SQL: Do not allow decode() rewrite by case/when/else when there
	  is a function call in it.
	- Fix Error when Compress::Zlib is not installed, this module is not
	  mandatory.

This is a new major release because it adds support to multiprocessing to export
data in parallel mode, this allow to improve speed during data import by more
than ten times. This multiprocessiing capabilities allow Ora2Pg to be closer than
the speed of any ETL. To compare speed or allow using Kettle for data import,
there's now a new export type to obtain Kettle XML transformation files. This
release adds also lot of work on speed improvement to scan Oracle database with
huge number of object.

	- Add documentation about JOBS, ORACLE_COPIES, DEFINED_PK configuration
	  directive and informations about KETTLE export type.

2012 12 12 - v10.0

This is the first version of Ora2Pg 10.x series, that is a major release.
Overall numerous improvements and bugs fixes there's now a new export type:
SHOW_REPORT that will output a report of all objects contained in your Oracle
database and some comments on how they will be exported. With this report you
can use a new directive ESTIMATE_COST to ask to Ora2Pg to evaluate the database
migration cost in terms of man days. There's also an other new configuration
directive EXTERNAL_TO_FDW, disable by default, to permit the export of all
Oracle external tables as file_fdw foreign tables.

The database content report and the migration cost estimation is a work in
progress so all feedback on these new features are welcome. Here is the complete
changelog:

	- Update documentation about ora2pg usage and new feature.
	- Fix quote escaping on table comments. Thanks to Sebastian Fischer.
	- Fix some other issues with 8i databases, added database version auto-
	  detection to avoid printinf warning. Thanks to Sebastian Fischer for
	  the help.

	- Update documentation about BFILE export.
	- Add drop function ora2pg_get_bfilename() when necessary.
	- Add support to BFILE external path export by creating a function
	  ora2pg_get_bfilename( p_bfile IN BFILE ) to retrieve path from BFILE.
	  BFILE will be exported as text field with the full path to the file as
	  value. Note that this is the first time that Ora2Pg need write access
	  to the Oracle database, if you do not have BFILE or you have set the
	  corresponding PostgreSQL type asd bytea (the default) the function
	  will not be created.
	- Fix a performance issue when extracting BLOB with a LongReadLen upper
	  than 1MB.
	- Fix priviledge on schema created from Oracle package body. Thanks to
	  Dominique Legendre for the report.
	- Add object type in comment before priviledge extraction.

	  grants export on all object.
	- Add export of VALID only views. To export all with INVALID ones you
	  must activate the EXPORT_INVALID directive. Thanks to Dominique
	  Legendre for the feature request.
	- Fix issue in substr() pl/sql replacement, thanks to Dominique
	  Legendre for the report, plus add other code replacements in pl/sql.
	- Fix issue with function name not on the same line as the create
	  statement - was affecting file input only.

	  herited and Subtype, Varrays. Associative Arrays, Type Body and type
	  with member method are not supported.
	- When FILE_PER_INDEX is enable, SQL order to move indexes in their
	  respective tablespace will be written into a dedicated file prefixed
	  by TBSP_INDEXES_.
	- Fix location on external table export. Thanks to Thomas Reiss for
	  the help.
	- PG_SUPPORTS_INSTEADOF is now activated by default, that mean that

UPGRADE: Ora2Pg.pm and ora2pg perl scripts have changed as well as configuration
file. Documentation has been updated too so you'd better install all again.

2012 04 30 - 8.11

	- Fix an error when running ora2pg directly against PG, index and
	  constraints are created against PG instead of being written to
	  the output file. Thanks to David Greco for the report.
	- Ora2Pg will now output a warning message when direct import to PG
	  is set with other import type than COPY and DATA.
	- Fix NUL character removing on LOB to bytea export. Thanks to info31
	  on PostgresqlFr for the report.

UPGRADE: only Ora2Pg.pm have changed so you can just override it. See also
documentation for new configuration directives: LONGREADLEN and LONGTRUNKOK.
	
2011 11 07 - 8.9

	- Fix double quote into file name of package function export when case
	  sensitivity is preserved.
	- Add support to XMLType data extraction. Thanks to Aaron Culich for
	  the report. Before this release, xml data was exported as a Perl
	  array reference.
	- Fix bug during foreign key export when foreign keys have different
	  owners. Thanks to Krasi Zlatev for the patch.
	- Add support to plpgsql conversion during index extraction as many
	  index use some Oracle function on their declaration. Thanks to
	  Sriram Chandrasekaran fot the feature request.
	- PLSQL: Add replacement of Oracle subtr() by PostgreSQL substring().
	  Thanks to Sriram Chandrasekaran fot the feature request.
	- PLSQL: Add replacement of Oracle decode() by PostgreSQL CASE/THEN/ELSE.
	  Thanks to Sriram Chandrasekaran fot the feature request.
	  Note that this two replacement was not implemented because they could
	  break the code if there's complex subqueries inside their declaration.
	  This is why you can enable it by setting ALLOW_CODE_BREAK to 1 (new).
	  In later release this directive will be enable by default.
	- Add output ordering on some object name so that results between two
	  runs can be compared. Thanks to Henk Enting for the patch.
	- Fix misshandling of all cases of RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR rewrite into
	  RAISE EXCEPTION concatenations. Thanks to Krasi Zlatev for the report.

UPGRADE: only Ora2Pg.pm and Ora2Pg/PSQL.pm have changed so you can just override them
if you dont want to reinstall all.

2011 10 13 - 8.8

	- Before that release when you upgraded Ora2Pg using Makefile, the old
	  ora2pg.conf was renamed as ora2pg.old. This can lead to lost previous
	  configuration, the old ora2pg.conf is now untouched and the new one is
	  installed as ora2pg.conf.new.
	- Renamed ora2pg.pl into ora2pg_pl in the package before installation
	  to avoid the copy of the perl script into the site Perl install dir.
	  It is still installed as ora2pg in /usr/local/bin by default.
	- Fix errors that appeared to be due to no quoting on the field names
	  when ORA_SENSITIVE is enabled. Thank to Sam Nelson for the patch.
	- Limit case sensitivity on check constraints to column names only,
	  before that if there was a value between double quote into the check
	  constraint, it was wrongly changed to lower case.
	- Fix broken case sensitivity at data export when disabling/enabling
	  triggers and truncating tables with copy or insert statement.
	- Change Ora2Pg version in packaging files that was still in 8.5.

UPGRADE: only Ora2Pg.pm have changed so you can just override it.

2011 09 07 - 8.7

	- The escape_bytea() function has been rewritten using a prebuild array
	  to gain twice of performances. Thanks to Marc Cousin from Dalibo for
	  the patch.
	- Improve speed of bulkload data by disabling autocommit by issuing a
	  BEGIN at the start and COMMIT at the end.
	- Add multi-threading support. It is only used to do the escaping to
	  convert LOBs to byteas, as it is very cpu hungry. There's a lot of
	  CPU-waste here. The threads number is controlled by a new configuration
	  directive: THREAD_COUNT. Putting 6 threads will only triple your
	  throughput, if your machine has enough cores. If zero (default value),
	  do not use threads, do not waste CPU, but be slower with bytea.
	  Performance seems to peak at 5 threads, if you have enough cores, and
	  triples throughput on tables having LOB. Another important thing:
	  because of the way threading works in perl, threads consume a lot of
	  memory. Put a low (5000 for instance) DATA_LIMIT if you activate
	  threading. Many thanks to Marc Cousin for this great patch.
	- Fix standard_conforming_string usage on export as INSERT statement.
	- Fix an issue with importing Oracle NULL character (\0 or char(0)) with
	  bytea and character data with UTF8 encoding. Now whatever is the data
	  type or the encoding, this character is simply removed to prevent the
	  well known 'ERROR: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0x00.'
	  Thanks to Jean-Paul Argudo from Dalibo for the report.
	- Fix an incorrect syntax for "for each statement" triggers.
	  Thanks to Henk Enting for the report.
	- Add comment at end of line to signal on which cursor the replacement
	  on " EXIT WHEN (...)%NOTFOUND " is done. This will return something 
	  like "IF NOT FOUND THEN EXIT; END IF; -- apply on $1". Thanks to
	  jehan Guillaume De Rorthais from Dalibo for the report this help a lot
	  during Pl/Pgsql code review.
	- Fix table/column name replacement on constraint creation and dropping
	  when REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS is set during DATA/COPY export.
	- Fix table/column name replacement on indexes creation and dropping
	  when REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS is set during DATA/COPY export.
	- Remove unused table name parameter in _drop_indexes() function.
	- Add support to REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS during schema export.
	  Before this release those replacements were only applied to DATA or
	  COPY export. You can now use it in schema export, it will replace
	  table and/or column names in the TABLE/INDEX/CONSTRAINT schema export.
	  MODIFY_STRUCT is still limited to DATA or COPY export as it have no
	  sense outside this export. Unfortunately those replacements can not be
	  done easilly in other export type like TRIGGER, FUNCTION, etc. so you
	  must still edit this code by hand.
	- Use the bundled Perl Config module to detect if Perl is compiled with
	  useithread. This mean that the old local defined %Config hash has been
	  replaced by %AConfig.
	- SKIP indices is now obsolete and must be replaced with SKIP indexes.
	  backward compatibility is preserved.
	- The file generated when FILE_PER_INDEX is activated has been renamed
	  into INDEXES_... instead of INDICES_...
	- Add a warning on tablespace export when Oracle user is not a dba.
	- Fix fatal error when dumping to one file per function with double
	  directory output.
	- Fix double print of FATAL messages and dirty database disconnect on
	  fatal errors.
	- Add setting of client_encoding into each export type as defined in
	  the configuration file.
	- Update web site documentation.

UPGRADE: Ora2Pg.pm, Ora2Pg/PGSQL.pm and ora2pg have changed so they must be
overwritten.  There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation
has changed as well. Backward compatibility is fully preserved.


2011 07 07 - 8.6

	- Remove "use strict" from head of Ora2Pg.pm that breaks view export.
	  This is usually removed before public release, but not this time.
	  Thanks to Jehan Guillaume de Rorthais from Dalibo for the report.
	- Add a new configuration directive called COMPILE_SCHEMA that force
	  Oracle to compile the PL/SQL before code extraction to validate
	  code that was invalidate for any reason before. If you set it to 1,
	  you will force compiling of the user session schema, but you can
	  specify the name of the schema to compile as the value too. Thanks
	  to Jean-Paul Argudo from Dalibo for the solution.
	- Add new configuration directive EXPORT_INVALID to allow export of all
	  PL/SQL code even if it is marked as invalid status. The 'VALID' or 
	  'INVALID' status applies to functions, procedures, packages and user
	  defined types.
	- Excluded from export all tables, types, views, functions and packages
	  that contains a $ character. Most of the time they don't need to be
	  exported.
	- PLSQL: add automatic conversion of Oracle SYS_REFURSOR as PostgreSQL
	  REFCURSOR.
	- Rewrite entirely the parser of DBMS_OUTPUT du to concatenation errors.
	- PLSQL: add automatic replacement of some Oracle exception errors:
          INVALID_CURSOR=>INVALID_CURSOR_STATE, ZERO_DIVIDE=>DIVISION_BY_ZERO,
          STORAGE_ERROR=>OUT_OF_MEMORY.

UPGRADE: Ora2Pg.pm and Ora2Pg/PGSQL.pm have changed so they must be overwritten.
There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation has changed as
well. Backward compatibility is fully preserved.


2011 07 01 - 8.5

	- When FILE_PER_FUNCTION is activated and export type is PACKAGE, Ora2Pg
	  will now save all functions/procedures of a package body into a
	  directory named as the package name and into different files. This
	  will allow to load each function separatly or load them all with the
	  OUTPUT SQL script generated by Ora2Pg.
	- Fix Oracle package body parsing failure when a procedure is declared
	  inside an other.
	- Add new configuration options FILE_PER_CONSTRAINT and FILE_PER_INDEX
	  to generate three files during the schema extraction. One for the
	  'CREATE TABLE' statements, one for the constraints (primary keys,
	  foreign keys, etc.) and the last one for indices. Thanks to Daniel
	  Scott for the feature request.
	- Allow to process PL/SQL Oracle code from file instead of a database
	  to apply Ora2Pg code conversion. Thank to Mindy Markowitz for the
	  feature request. See -i or --input_file command line option to ora2pg
	  perl script or INPUT_FILE new configuration option.
	- Add new configuration directive STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS that is
	  used only during DATA export type to build INSERT statements. This
	  should avoid 'WARNING:  nonstandard use of \\ in a string literal'.
	  Please check that this behavior is backward compatible with your
	  PostgreSQL usage as this is enabled by default now.

UPGRADE: The new features has changed Ora2Pg.pm and ora2pg.pl so that they must
be overwritten. There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation
has changed as well. Take care of backward compatibility with escaped strings in
DATA export type and the new behavior on PACKAGE export. 

2011 06 07 - 8.4

	- Moves Ora2Pg to SourceForge.net.
	- Fix an issue on setting owner in "ALTER SEQUENCE ... SET OWNER TO".
	  Thanks to Herve Girres for the report.
	- Bugfix on lower case convertion for check constraints extraction.
	  Thanks to Alexander Korotkov for the patch.

UPGRADE: There's no new functionality, this is a bug fix release.

2011 05 11 - 8.3

	- Fix issue on inherited user defined types converted to inherited tables.
	  Add comment on unsupported inherited type in PostgreSQL too. Thanks to
	  Mathieu Wingel for the report.
	- Fix issue on column default values. Oracle all this kind of strange
	  syntax: counter NUMBER(4) default '' not null, that was translated to
	  counter smallint DEFAULT '' by Ora2Pg. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel this is
	  now rewritten as DEFAULT NOT NULL.
	- Fix case sensitivity on create view when there was double quote on the
	  column name statement part. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel or the report.
	- Fix bad patch applied on column name case sensitivity issue during check
	  constraint export. Thanks to Philippe Rimbault for the report.
	- Fix bug on package export introduced into version v8.2. The issue was
	  related to end of package procedure detection. hanks to Mathieu Wingel
	  or the report.

UPGRADE: There's no new functionality, this is a bug fix release and every one
should upgrade to it.


2011 05 01 - 8.2

	- PLSQL: automatic replacement of EXIT WHEN cursor%NOTFOUND; by Pg
	  synthax: IF NOT FOUND THEN EXIT; END IF;. Works with additional
	  condition too.
	- PLSQL: Automatic replacement of SQL%NOTFOUND by NOT FOUND.
	- PLSQL: Add detection of TOO_MANY_ROW to NO_DATA_FOUND to add STRICT.
	- Completely rewrite the parsing of Oracle package body to handle all
	  cases and especially prodedure declared into an other procedure.
	  Those procedure are renamed INTERNAL_FUNCTION and must be rewritten.
	- Fix type usage of ora2pg Perl script.
	- Add a new directive FORCE_OWNER. By default the owner of the database
	  objects is the one you're using to connect to PostgreSQL. If you use
	  an other user (postgres for exemple) you can force Ora2Pg to set the
	  object owner to be the one used in the Oracle database by setting the
	  directive to 1, or to a completely different username by setting the
	  directive value to that username. Thanks to Herve Girres from Meteo
	  France for the suggestion and patch.
	- Add --forceowner or -f command line option to ora2pg program.
	- Add SHOW_ENCODING extract type to return the Oracle session encoding.
	  For example it can return: NLS_LANG AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8 
	- Remove SYS_EXTRACT_UTC from index creation as Pg always stores them
	  in UTC. Thanks to Daniel Scott for the patch.
	- In PLSQL code SYS_EXTRACT_UTC is replaced by the Pg syntaxe:
	  field AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'.
	- Fix a pending problem with "Wide character in print at" on COPY mode.
	  Thanks to Bernd Helmle from Credativ GmbH for the patch.
	- PLSQL: Add automatic rewrite of FOR ... IN REVERSE ... into Pg synthax
	- Fix column name case sensitivity issue during check constraint export.
	  Thanks to Daniel Berger for the report.
	- Remove the possibility to add comment after a configuration directive
	  it may not be used and it was generating an issue with the passwords
	  configuration directives for examples. Thanks to Daniel Berger for the
	  report.
	- Complete rewrite of user defined type extraction. Add support of inherited
	  type using Oracle UNDER keyword as well as better support to custom type
	  with BODY. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel for the report.
	- Fix case sensitivity on user defined types. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel for
	  the report.

UPGRADE: All files have changed so you need a fresh install/upgrade.
Previous release used to remove any string starting from a # in the config file,
this was to allow comments after a configuration directive. This possibility
have been removed in this release so you can no more add comments after a
configuration directive.


2011 03 28 - 8.1

	- Prevent Ora2PG to export twice datas when using FILE_PER_TABLE and
	  the data output file exist. This is useful in case of export failure
	  and you don't want to export all data again. This also mean that if
	  you want to get new data you have to remove the old files before.
	- Fix parsing of procedure/function into pl/sql Oracle package.
	- Fix bug in IS NULL/IS NOT NULL replacement. Thanks to Jean-Paul Argudo
	  from Dalibo for the report.
	- Add CREATE OR REPLACE on RULE creation.
	- Add DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS before trigger creation.

	- Apply excluded and limited table to tablespace extraction.
	- Fix function and procedure detection/parsing on package content.
	- Fix schema prefix in function name declaration in package export. 
	- PLSQL: Replace some way of extracting date part of a date :
	  TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(...)) rewritten into TO_CHAR(...)::integer when
	  TO_NUMBER just have one argument.
	- Fix Makefile.pl error when trying to modify file ora2pg now renamed
	  into ora2pg.pl
	- Add 3 new export types SHOW_SCHEMA, SHOW_TABLE and SHOW_COLUMN. Those
	  new extraction keyword are use to only display the requested information
	  and exit. This allow you to quickly know on what you are going to work.
	  The SHOW_COLUMN allow a new ora2pg command line option: '--xtable relname'
	  or '-x relname' to limit the displayed information to the given table.
	- Add type replacement for BINARY_INTEGER and PLS_INTEGER as integer.

UPGRADE: Please make a full upgrade asap to this release.

	- Add DROP_FKEY configuration directive to force deletion of foreign keys
	  before the import and recreate them and the end of the import. This may
	  help if DEFER_FKEY not works for you.
	- Add DROP_INDEX configuration directive to force deletion of all indexes
	  except the automatic index (primary keys) before data import and to
	  recreate them at end. This can be used to gain speed during import.
	- Add TSMSYS, FLOWS_020100 and FLOWS_FILES to the owners exclude list.
	  This concern the SRS$ table and all tables begining with 'WWV_FLOW_'
	- Change the way DATA_LIMIT is working. It must be used now to set the

	- Publish a dedicated site to Ora2Pg at http://ora2pg.darold.net/
	- Add export of Oracle table partitoning. See export type PARTITION.
	- Add command line arguments to perl script ora2pg. See --help for a
	  full listing of these option. The most interesting is --type to change
	  the export type directly at command execution without needing to edit
	  the configuration file, --plsql to directly enable PLSQL to PLPSQL
	  code conversion and --source, --user --password to set Oracle data
	  source. There's also --namespace to set the Oracle schema.
	- Create all file for standard Perl module install. Install is now done
	  with: perl Makefile.PL && make && make install
	- Move Ora2Pg license from Perl Artistics to GPLv3.

	- Fix debug filename output on multiple export file. Thanks to Leo
	Mannhart for the report.

2009 07 07 - version 5.3

	- Fix wrong escaping of data named as column during view export. Thank
	to Andrea Agosti for the patch.
	- Allow export of datas into one file per table. See FILE_PER_TABLE
	configuration directive. Thanks to Alexandre - Aldeia Digital for the
	idea.

2009 06 19 - version 5.2

	- Fix order of the column name of the view which was not preserved. Now
	ordered by COLUMN_ID. Thank to Andrea Agosti for the report.

	Thanks to Olivier Mazain for the report.
	- Configuration file directives are now case insensitive.
	- Force $type parameter given to _sql_type() to be uppercase in that
	methode instead of during function call. Thanks to Ali Pouya for the
	report.
	- Modify ora2pg.pl to remove the obsolete call to export_data(). Use
	only export_schema() now.
	- Modify ora2pg.pl to simplify it. Reading configuration is now done
	internally by Ora2Pg.pm as well as all other initialization process.
	You can always overwrite all configuration options into call to new
	Ora2Pg(). Now ora2pg.pl can be as simple as:

		use Ora2Pg;
		my $schema = new Ora2Pg('config' => "/etc/ora2pg.conf");
		$schema->export_schema();
		exit(0);

	This will be less confusing. You can upgrade Ora2Pg.pm without carring
	about that, backward compatibility with previous version is preserved.
	- Review entire documentation with the great help of Ali Pouya.
	- Add type BOOLEAN converted to boolean.
	- PG_SUPPORTS_INOUT is now enabled by default in the configuration file
	- SQL and PL/SQL to PLPGSQL converter:
	    .Replace MINUS call to EXCEPT
	    .Replace DBMS_OUTPUT.put, DBMS_OUTPUT.put_line, DBMS_OUTPUT.new_line
	     by the PLPGSQL equivalent: RAISE NOTICE
	    .Rewrite function/procedure/package convertion functions.
	This Oracle SQL converter for function/procedure/package is now only
	applied if the configuration directive PLSQL_PGSQL is enable, else
	these Oracle code are exported as is. Thanks to Ali Pouya for the help.

	- Reserved call to sql transaction only for DATA export type. Others
	export type now use \set ON_ERROR_STOP ON. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Fix tablespace creation into schema (missing search_path). Thanks to
	Olivier Mazain.
	- Fix the type returned by the _sql_type() method in the case of a
	numeric with null len and pg_numeric_type is set. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Change function body delimiter to $body$ to allow use of $$ into the
	body as quote replacement. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Fix returns type from function. If multiple OUT parameters: RECORD,
	if only one OUT parameter, return his type. If no out parameter: return
	VOID. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Fix export DATA when the name of a column in the table match COMMENT,
	AUDIT or any other defined reserved words. These reserved words are
	defined in a new configuration variable ORA_RESERVED_WORDS. It accept
	a list of comma separated reserved words. Thanks to Andrea Agosti for
	the report.
	- Fix configuration parser that omit custom SYSUSERS definition.

2009 02 13 - version 5.0

	- Fix places where $self->{prefix} where not used. This prefix is
	used to replace DBA_... objects into ALL_... objects. Thanks to Daniel
	Scott report and patch.
	- Fix some problem on trigger export (missing ending semicolon, return
	opaque replaced by return trigger, add missing return new value, single
	quote for delimitating the function body hits against quotes inside the
	function). Thanks to Luca DallOlio for reports and patches.
	- Add first attempt to rewrite plsql code to plpgsql code (see function
	plsql_to_plpgsql in new perl module PLSQL.pm). There's a configuration
	option named PLSQL_PGSQL to activate the convertion.

2008 12 16 - version 4.11

	- Fix Ora2Pg failure on Oracle database with case sensitive tables.
	Thanks to Marc Cousin for report and patch.
	- Fix missing schema name in query when extract views as tables.

2008 12 04 - version 4.10

	- Fix missing replacement of table name on disable triggers when
	  required.
	- Fix some malformed debug output messages.
	- Add the capability to extract data from view as if it was a table.
	  This is usefull if you want to export/import data from an Oracle
	  view into a Pg table. There's nothing special to do, just to give
	  the view name into the TABLES configuration directive and set TYPE
	  to DATA or COPY. If views are not specified in the TABLES directive
	  there's not view export but only table data.
	- Add capability to extract views structure as table schema. There's
	  nothing special to do, just to give the view name into the TABLES
	  configuration directive and set TYPE to TABLE. This will not extract
	  constraints or other table tuning from table used in the view. Thanks
	  to Groupe SAMSE for the feature request.

2008 10 27 - version 4.9

	- Modify the DISABLE_TABLE_TRIGGERS configuration option. Should be now
	  replaced by DISABLE_TRIGGERS, but compatibility is preserved.

	  separated list of Oracle System user/schema to exclude from extracted
	  object. By default it only exclude user SYS,SYSTEM,DBSNMP,OUTLN and 
	  PERFSTAT
	- Add support to other binary mode output than ':raw' to avoid the Perl
	  error message:"Wide character in print". See the BINMODE configuration
	  directive. This will help a lot if you have UTF-8 records.
	  Thank to Guillaume Demillecamps for the report.
	- Fix double escaping of special character.
	  Thank to Guillaume Demillecamps for the report.

2008 01 25 - version 4.7

	  adjust the sequence to the correct values after DATA and COPY dumps.
	  Thanks to Bernd Helmle.
	- Applied a patch which fixes problems with broken COPY output when
	  extracting data from Orace databases with embedded tabs, carriage
	  returns and line feeds. Thanks to Bernd Helmle.
	- Move the project to PgFoundry
