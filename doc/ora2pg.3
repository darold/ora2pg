.SH NAME
Ora2Pg \- Oracle to PostgreSQL database schema converter
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Ora2Pg is a free tool used to migrate an Oracle database to a PostgreSQL
compatible schema. It connects to your Oracle database, scans it automatically
and extracts its structure or data, then generates SQL scripts that you can
load into your PostgreSQL database.
.PP
Ora2Pg can be used for anything from reverse engineering an Oracle database to
huge enterprise database migration or simply replicating some Oracle data into
a PostgreSQL database. It is really easy to use and doesn't require any Oracle
database knowledge other than providing the parameters needed to connect to the
Oracle database.
.SH FEATURES
.IX Header "FEATURES"
Ora2Pg consists of a Perl script (ora2pg) and a Perl module (Ora2Pg.pm). The
only thing you have to modify is the configuration file ora2pg.conf by setting
the DSN to the Oracle database and optionally the name of a schema. Once that's
done, you just have to set the type of export you want: TABLE with constraints,
VIEW, MVIEW, TABLESPACE, SEQUENCE, INDEXES, TRIGGER, GRANT, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE,
PACKAGE, PARTITION, TYPE, INSERT or COPY, FDW, QUERY, KETTLE, SYNONYM.
.PP
By default, Ora2Pg exports to a file that you can load into PostgreSQL with the
psql client, but you can also import directly into a PostgreSQL database by
setting its DSN into the configuration file. With all configuration options of
ora2pg.conf, you have full control of what should be exported and how.
.PP
Features included:
.PP
.Vb 10

.PP
Ora2Pg does its best to automatically convert your Oracle database to PostgreSQL
but there's still manual work to do. The Oracle specific PL/SQL code generated
for functions, procedures, packages and triggers has to be reviewed to match
the PostgreSQL syntax. You will find some useful recommendations on porting
Oracle PL/SQL code to PostgreSQL PL/PGSQL at "Converting from other Databases
to PostgreSQL", section: Oracle (http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Main_Page).
.PP
See http://ora2pg.darold.net/report.html for an HTML sample of an Oracle database
migration report.
.SH INSTALLATION
.IX Header "INSTALLATION"
All Perl modules can always be found at CPAN (http://search.cpan.org/). Just
type the full name of the module (ex: DBD::Oracle) into the search input box,
it will bring you to the page for download.
.PP
Releases of Ora2Pg are published at SF.net (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ora2pg/).
.PP
On Windows(TM) you should install Strawberry Perl (http://strawberryperl.com/)
and the OSes corresponding Oracle clients. Since version 5.32, the Perl
distribution includes pre-compiled driver for DBD::Oracle and DBD::Pg.
.SS Required
.IX Subsection "Required"
The Oracle Instant Client or a full Oracle installation must be installed on
the system. You can download the RPM from Oracle download center:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    rpm \-ivh oracle\-instantclient12.2\-basic\-12.2.0.1.0\-1.x86_64.rpm
\&    rpm \-ivh oracle\-instantclient12.2\-devel\-12.2.0.1.0\-1.x86_64.rpm
\&    rpm \-ivh oracle\-instantclient12.2\-jdbc\-12.2.0.1.0\-1.x86_64.rpm
\&    rpm \-ivh oracle\-instantclient12.2\-sqlplus\-12.2.0.1.0\-1.x86_64.rpm
.Ve
.PP
or simply download the corresponding ZIP archives from Oracle download center
and install them where you want, for example: /opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2/
.PP
You also need a modern Perl distribution (Perl 5.10 or later). To connect to a
database and proceed with its migration, you need the DBI Perl module > 1.614.
To migrate an Oracle database, you need the DBD::Oracle Perl module to be
installed.
.PP
To install DBD::Oracle and have it working, you need to have the Oracle client
libraries installed and the ORACLE_HOME environment variable must be defined.
.PP
If you plan to export a MySQL database, you need to install the Perl module
DBD::MySQL which requires that the MySQL client libraries are installed.
.PP
If you plan to export a SQL Server database, you need to install the Perl module
DBD::ODBC which requires that the unixODBC package is installed.
.PP
On some Perl distributions, you may need to install the Time::HiRes Perl module.
.PP
If your distribution doesn't include these Perl modules, you can install them
using CPAN:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall DBD::Oracle\*(Aq
\&        perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall DBD::MySQL\*(Aq
\&        perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall DBD::ODBC\*(Aq
\&        perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall Time::HiRes\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
otherwise, use the packages provided by your distribution.
.SS Optional
.IX Subsection "Optional"
By default, Ora2Pg dumps exports to flat files. To load them into your PostgreSQL
database, you need the PostgreSQL client (psql). If you don't have it on the
host running Ora2Pg, you can always transfer these files to a host with the psql
client installed. If you prefer to load exports 'on the fly', the Perl module
DBD::Pg is required.
.PP
Ora2Pg allows you to dump all output in a compressed gzip file. To do this, you
need the Compress::Zlib Perl module or, if you prefer using bzip2 compression,
the program bzip2 must be available in your PATH.
.PP
If your distribution doesn't include these Perl modules, you can install them
using CPAN:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall DBD::Pg\*(Aq
\&        perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall Compress::Zlib\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
otherwise, use the packages provided by your distribution.
.SS "Instruction for SQL Server"
.IX Subsection "Instruction for SQL Server"
For SQL Server, you need to install the unixodbc package and the Perl
DBD::ODBC driver:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        sudo apt install unixodbc
\&        sudo apt install libdbd\-odbc\-perl
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        sudo yum install unixodbc
\&        sudo yum install perl\-DBD\-ODBC
\&        sudo yum install perl\-DBD\-Pg
.Ve
.PP
Then install the Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server. Follow the instructions
for to your operating system from here:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        https://docs.microsoft.com/fr\-fr/sql/connect/odbc/linux\-mac/installing\-the\-microsoft\-odbc\-driver\-for\-sql\-server?view=sql\-server\-ver16
.Ve
.PP
Once done, set the following in the /etc/odbcinst.ini file by adjusting
the SQL Server ODBC driver version:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        [msodbcsql18]
\&        Description=Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server
\&        Driver=/opt/microsoft/msodbcsql18/lib64/libmsodbcsql\-18.0.so.1.1
\&        UsageCount=1
.Ve
.PP
See ORACLE_DSN to learn how to use the driver to connect to your MSSQL database.
.SS "Installing Ora2Pg"
.IX Subsection "Installing Ora2Pg"
Like any other Perl Module, Ora2Pg can be installed with the following commands:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        tar xjf ora2pg\-x.x.tar.bz2
\&        cd ora2pg\-x.x/
\&        perl Makefile.PL
\&        make && make install
.Ve
.PP
This will install Ora2Pg.pm into your site Perl repository, ora2pg into
/usr/local/bin/ and ora2pg.conf into /etc/ora2pg/.
.PP
On Windows(TM), you may use instead:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        perl Makefile.PL
\&        gmake && gmake install
.Ve
.PP
This will install scripts and libraries into your Perl site installation
directory and the ora2pg.conf file as well as all documentation files
into C:\eora2pg\e
.PP
To install ora2pg in a different directory than the default one, simply
use this command:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=<your_install_dir>
\&        make && make install
.Ve
.PP
then set PERL5LIB to the path to your installation directory before using
Ora2Pg.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        export PERL5LIB=<your_install_dir>
\&        ora2pg \-c config/ora2pg.conf \-t TABLE \-b outdir/
.Ve
.SS Packaging
.IX Subsection "Packaging"
If you want to build binary packages for your preferred Linux distribution,
take a look at the packaging/ directory of the source tarball. It contains
everything needed to build RPM, Slackware and Debian packages. See the README file in
that directory.
.SS "Installing DBD::Oracle"
.IX Subsection "Installing DBD::Oracle"
Ora2Pg needs the Perl module DBD::Oracle for connectivity to an Oracle database
from Perl DBI. You can get DBD::Oracle from CPAN, a Perl module repository.
.PP
After setting ORACLE_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables as root
user, install DBD::Oracle. Proceed as follows:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib
\&        export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64
\&        perl \-MCPAN \-e \*(Aqinstall DBD::Oracle\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
If you are running for the first time, it will ask many questions; you can keep
defaults by pressing ENTER key, but you need to provide one appropriate mirror
site for CPAN to download the modules. Install through CPAN manually if the
above doesn't work:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&        #perl \-MCPAN \-e shell
\&        cpan> get DBD::Oracle
\&        cpan> quit
\&        cd ~/.cpan/build/DBD\-Oracle*
\&        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib
\&        export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64
\&        perl Makefile.PL
\&        make
\&        make install
.Ve
.PP
Installing DBD::Oracle requires that the three Oracle packages: instant-client,
SDK and SQLplus are installed as well as the libaio1 library.
.PP
If you are using Instant Client from ZIP archives, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and
ORACLE_HOME will be the same and must be set to the directory where you have
installed the files. For example: /opt/oracle/instantclient_12_2/
.SH CONFIGURATION
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION"
Configuring Ora2Pg can be as simple as choosing the Oracle database to export
and choosing the export type. This can be done in a minute.
.PP
By reading this documentation you will also be able to:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        \- Select only certain tables and/or columns for export.
\&        \- Rename some tables and/or columns during export.
\&        \- Select data to export following a WHERE clause per table.
\&        \- Delay database constraints during data loading.
\&        \- Compress exported data to save disk space.
\&        \- and much more.
.Ve
.PP
The Oracle database migration is fully controlled through a single
configuration file named ora2pg.conf. The format of this file consists of a
directive name in upper case followed by a tab character and a value.
Comments are lines beginning with a #.
.PP
There's no specific order to place the configuration directives, they are
set at the time they are read in the configuration file.
.PP
For configuration directives that just take a single value, you can use them
multiple times in the configuration file but only the last occurrence found
in the file will be used. For configuration directives that allow a list
of values, you can use them multiple times, the values will be appended to the
list. If you use the IMPORT directive to load a custom configuration file,
directives defined in this file will be stored from the place the IMPORT
directive is found, so it is better to put it at the end of the configuration
file.
.PP
Values set in command line options will override values from the configuration
file.
.SS "Ora2Pg usage"
.IX Subsection "Ora2Pg usage"
First of all be sure that libraries and binaries paths include the Oracle
Instant Client installation:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/lib
\&        export PATH="/usr/lib/oracle/11.2/client64/bin:$PATH"
.Ve
.PP
By default, Ora2Pg will look for /etc/ora2pg/ora2pg.conf configuration file. If
the file exists, you can simply execute:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        /usr/local/bin/ora2pg
.Ve
.PP
or under Windows(TM) run ora2pg.bat file, located in your Perl bin directory.
Windows(TM) users may also find a template configuration file in C:\eora2pg
.PP
If you want to call another configuration file, just give the path as a command
line argument:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        /usr/local/bin/ora2pg \-c /etc/ora2pg/new_ora2pg.conf
.Ve
.PP
Here are all command line parameters available when using ora2pg:

\&   \-\-oracle_fdw_prefetch: Set the oracle_fdw prefetch value. Larger values
\&                        generally result in faster data transfer at the cost

ora2pg will return 0 on success, 1 on error. It will return 2 when a child
process has been interrupted and you've gotten the warning message:
    "WARNING: an error occured during data export. Please check what's happened."
Most of the time this is an OOM issue, so first try reducing DATA_LIMIT value.
.PP
For developers, it is possible to add your own custom option(s) in the Perl
script ora2pg as any configuration directive from ora2pg.conf can be passed
in lower case to the new Ora2Pg object instance. See ora2pg code on how to
add your own option.

.SS "Generate a migration template"
.IX Subsection "Generate a migration template"
The two options \-\-project_base and \-\-init_project indicate to ora2pg
that it should create a project template with a work tree, a configuration
file and a script to export all objects from the Oracle database. Here is a sample
of the command usage:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&        ora2pg \-\-project_base /app/migration/ \-\-init_project test_project

\&        Generating generic configuration file

\&        Creating script import_all.sh to automate all imports.
.Ve
.PP
It creates a generic config file where you just have to define the Oracle
database connection and a shell script called export_schema.sh. The sources/
directory will contain the Oracle code, the schema/ directory will contain the code
ported to PostgreSQL. The reports/ directory will contain the HTML and JSON
reports with the migration cost assessment.
.PP
If you want to use your own default config file, use the \-c option to give
the path to that file. Rename it with .dist suffix if you want ora2pg to
apply the generic configuration values; otherwise, the configuration file
will be copied untouched.
.PP
Once you have set the connection to the Oracle Database you can execute the
script export_schema.sh that will export all object types from your Oracle
database and output DDL files into the schema's subdirectories. At end of the
export it will give you the command to export data later when the import of
the schema is done and verified.
.PP
You can choose to load the DDL files generated manually or use the second
script import_all.sh to import those files interactively. If this kind of
migration is not something common for you, it's recommended that you use those
scripts.
.SS "Oracle database connection"
.IX Subsection "Oracle database connection"
There are 5 configuration directives to control the access to the Oracle database.
.IP ORACLE_HOME 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_HOME"
Used to set the ORACLE_HOME environment variable for the Oracle libraries required
by the DBD::Oracle Perl module.
.IP ORACLE_DSN 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_DSN"
This directive is used to set the data source name in the standard DBI DSN form.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:Oracle:host=oradb_host.myhost.com;sid=DB_SID;port=1521
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:Oracle:DB_SID
.Ve
.Sp
On 18c this could be for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:Oracle:host=192.168.1.29;service_name=pdb1;port=1521
.Ve
.Sp
For the second notation, the SID should be declared in the well-known file
\&\f(CW$ORACLE_HOME\fR/network/admin/tnsnames.ora or in the path given to the TNS_ADMIN
environment variable.
.Sp
For MySQL the DSN will look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:mysql:host=192.168.1.10;database=sakila;port=3306
.Ve
.Sp
The 'sid' part is replaced by 'database'.
.Sp
For MS SQL Server it will look like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:ODBC:driver=msodbcsql18;server=mydb.database.windows.net;database=testdb;TrustServerCertificate=yes
.Ve
.IP "ORACLE_USER and ORACLE_PWD" 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_USER and ORACLE_PWD"
These two directives are used to define the user and password for the Oracle
database connection. Note that if possible, it is better to login as Oracle super
admin to avoid grant problems during the database scan and ensure nothing
is missing.
.Sp
If you do not supply credentials with ORACLE_PWD and you have installed the
Term::ReadKey Perl module, Ora2Pg will ask for the password interactively. If
ORACLE_USER is not set it will also be asked interactively.
.Sp
To connect to a local ORACLE instance with connections "as sysdba" you have to
set ORACLE_USER to "/" and an empty password.
.Sp
To make a connection using an Oracle Secure External Password Store (SEPS), 
first configure the Oracle Wallet and then set both the ORACLE_USER and 
ORACLE_PWD directives to the special value of "_\|_SEPS_\|_" (without the quotes 
but with the double underscore).
.IP USER_GRANTS 4
.IX Item "USER_GRANTS"
Set this directive to 1 if you connect to Oracle database as a simple user and
do not have enough grants to extract things from the DBA_... tables. It will
use ALL_... tables instead.
.Sp
Warning: if you use export type GRANT, you must set this configuration option
to 0 or it will not work.
.IP TRANSACTION 4
.IX Item "TRANSACTION"
This directive may be used if you want to change the default isolation level of
the data export transaction. Default is now to set the level to a serializable
transaction to ensure data consistency. The allowed values for this directive
are:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        readonly: \*(AqSET TRANSACTION READ ONLY\*(Aq,
\&        readwrite: \*(AqSET TRANSACTION READ WRITE\*(Aq,
\&        serializable: \*(AqSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE\*(Aq
\&        committed: \*(AqSET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED\*(Aq,
.Ve
.Sp
Releases before 6.2 used to set the isolation level to READ ONLY transaction
but in some cases this was breaking data consistency so now default is set to
SERIALIZABLE.
.IP INPUT_FILE 4
.IX Item "INPUT_FILE"
This directive does not control the Oracle database connection but rather it
purely disables the use of any Oracle database by accepting a file as argument.
Set this directive to a file containing PL/SQL Oracle Code like function,
procedure or full package body to prevent Ora2Pg from connecting to an
Oracle database and just apply its conversion tool to the content of the
file. This can be used with most export types: TABLE, TRIGGER, PROCEDURE,
VIEW, FUNCTION or PACKAGE, etc.
.IP ORA_INITIAL_COMMAND 4
.IX Item "ORA_INITIAL_COMMAND"
This directive can be used to send an initial command to Oracle, just after
the connection. For example to unlock a policy before reading objects or
to set some session parameters. This directive can be used multiple times.
.SS "Data encryption with Oracle server"
.IX Subsection "Data encryption with Oracle server"
If your Oracle Client config file already includes the encryption method,
then DBD::Oracle uses those settings to encrypt the connection while
extracting data. For example, if you have configured the Oracle Client
config file (sqlnet.ora or .sqlnet) with the following information:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        # Configure encryption of connections to Oracle
\&        SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_CLIENT = required
\&        SQLNET.ENCRYPTION_TYPES_CLIENT = (AES256, RC4_256)
\&        SQLNET.CRYPTO_SEED = \*(Aqshould be 10\-70 random characters\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Any tool that uses the Oracle client to communicate with the database will have
encrypted connections if you setup session encryption as shown above.
.PP
For example, Perl's DBI uses DBD::Oracle, which uses the Oracle client
for actual database communication. If the
Oracle client installation used by Perl is setup to request encrypted connections,
then your Perl connection to an Oracle database will also be encrypted.
.PP
Full details at https://kb.berkeley.edu/jivekb/entry.jspa?externalID=1005
.SS "Testing connection"
.IX Subsection "Testing connection"
Once you have set the Oracle database DSN, you can execute ora2pg to see if
it works:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-t SHOW_VERSION \-c config/ora2pg.conf
.Ve
.PP
will show the Oracle database server version. Take some time here to test your
installation as most problems occur here. The other configuration
steps are more technical.
.SS Troubleshooting
.IX Subsection "Troubleshooting"
If the output.sql file hasn't exported anything other than the PostgreSQL transaction
header and footer, there are two possible reasons: 1) The perl script ora2pg dumps
an ORA-XXX error, which means that your DSN or login information is wrong \- check
the error and your settings and try again. 2) The perl script says nothing and the
output file is empty: the user lacks permissions to extract something from
the database. Try to connect to Oracle as super user or review the
USER_GRANTS directive above and the next section, especially the SCHEMA directive.
.IP LOGFILE 4
.IX Item "LOGFILE"
By default, all messages are sent to the standard output. If you provide a file
path to this directive, all output will be appended to this file.
.SS "Oracle schema to export"
.IX Subsection "Oracle schema to export"
The Oracle database export can be limited to a specific Schema or Namespace;
this may be mandatory depending on the database connection user.
.IP SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "SCHEMA"
This directive is used to set the schema name to use during export.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SCHEMA  APPS
.Ve
.Sp
will extract objects associated with the APPS schema.
.Sp
When no schema name is provided and EXPORT_SCHEMA is enabled, Ora2Pg
will export all objects from all schemas of the Oracle instance with
their names prefixed with the schema name.
.IP EXPORT_SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "EXPORT_SCHEMA"
By default, the Oracle schema is not exported into the PostgreSQL database and
all objects are created under the default Pg namespace. If you want to also
export this schema and create all objects under this namespace, set the
EXPORT_SCHEMA directive to 1. This will set the schema search_path at the top of
the export SQL file to the schema name set in the SCHEMA directive with the default
pg_catalog schema. If you want to change this path, use the directive PG_SCHEMA.
.IP CREATE_SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "CREATE_SCHEMA"
Enable/disable the CREATE SCHEMA SQL order at the start of the output file.
It is enabled by default and concerns the TABLE export type.
.IP COMPILE_SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "COMPILE_SCHEMA"
By default, Ora2Pg will only export valid PL/SQL code. You can force Oracle to
compile again the invalidated code to get a chance to have it obtain the valid
status and then be able to export it.
.Sp
Enable this directive to force Oracle to compile schema before exporting code.
When this directive is enabled and SCHEMA is set to a specific schema name,
only invalid objects in this schema will be recompiled. If SCHEMA is not set
then all schema will be recompiled. To force recompilation of invalid object in a
specific schema, set COMPILE_SCHEMA to the schema name you want to recompile.
.Sp
This will ask Oracle to validate the PL/SQL that could have been invalidated
after an export/import for example. The 'VALID' or 'INVALID' status applies to
functions, procedures, packages and user defined types. It also concerns disabled
triggers.
.IP EXPORT_INVALID 4
.IX Item "EXPORT_INVALID"
If the above configuration directive is not enough to validate your PL/SQL code,
enable this configuration directive to allow export of all PL/SQL code even if
it is marked as invalid. The 'VALID' or 'INVALID' status applies to functions,
procedures, packages, triggers and user defined types.
.IP PG_SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "PG_SCHEMA"
Allows you to define/force the PostgreSQL schema to use. By default, if you set
EXPORT_SCHEMA to 1, the PostgreSQL search_path will be set to the schema name
exported set as value of the SCHEMA directive.
.Sp
The value can be a comma-delimited list of schema names but not when using TABLE
export type because in this case it will generate the CREATE SCHEMA statement
and it doesn't support multiple schema names. For example, if you set PG_SCHEMA
to something like "user_schema, public", the search path will be set like this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SET search_path = user_schema, public;
.Ve
.Sp
forcing the use of an other schema (here user_schema) than the one from Oracle
schema set in the SCHEMA directive.
.Sp
You can also set the default search_path for the PostgreSQL user you are using
to connect to the destination database by using:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ALTER ROLE username SET search_path TO user_schema, public;
.Ve
.Sp
in this case you don't have to set PG_SCHEMA.
.IP SYSUSERS 4
.IX Item "SYSUSERS"
Without explicit schema, Ora2Pg will export all objects that do not belong to
system schemas or roles:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        SYSTEM,CTXSYS,DBSNMP,EXFSYS,LBACSYS,MDSYS,MGMT_VIEW,
\&        OLAPSYS,ORDDATA,OWBSYS,ORDPLUGINS,ORDSYS,OUTLN,
\&        SI_INFORMTN_SCHEMA,SYS,SYSMAN,WK_TEST,WKSYS,WKPROXY,
\&        WMSYS,XDB,APEX_PUBLIC_USER,DIP,FLOWS_020100,FLOWS_030000,
\&        FLOWS_040100,FLOWS_010600,FLOWS_FILES,MDDATA,ORACLE_OCM,
\&        SPATIAL_CSW_ADMIN_USR,SPATIAL_WFS_ADMIN_USR,XS$NULL,PERFSTAT,
\&        SQLTXPLAIN,DMSYS,TSMSYS,WKSYS,APEX_040000,APEX_040200,
\&        DVSYS,OJVMSYS,GSMADMIN_INTERNAL,APPQOSSYS,DVSYS,DVF,
\&        AUDSYS,APEX_030200,MGMT_VIEW,ODM,ODM_MTR,TRACESRV,MTMSYS,
\&        OWBSYS_AUDIT,WEBSYS,WK_PROXY,OSE$HTTP$ADMIN,
\&        AURORA$JIS$UTILITY$,AURORA$ORB$UNAUTHENTICATED,
\&        DBMS_PRIVILEGE_CAPTURE,CSMIG,MGDSYS,SDE,DBSFWUSER
.Ve
.Sp
Depending on your Oracle installation, you may have several other system roles
defined. To append these users to the schema exclusion list, just set the
SYSUSERS configuration directive to a comma-separated list of system users to
exclude. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SYSUSERS        INTERNAL,SYSDBA,BI,HR,IX,OE,PM,SH
.Ve
.Sp
will add users INTERNAL and SYSDBA to the schema exclusion list.
.IP FORCE_OWNER 4
.IX Item "FORCE_OWNER"
By default, the owner of the database objects is the one you're using to connect
to PostgreSQL using the psql command. If you use an other user (postgres for example),
you can force Ora2Pg to set the object owner to be the one used in the Oracle database
by setting the directive to 1, or to a completely different username by setting the
directive value to that username.
.IP FORCE_SECURITY_INVOKER 4
.IX Item "FORCE_SECURITY_INVOKER"
Ora2Pg uses the function's security privileges set in Oracle and it is often
defined as SECURITY DEFINER. If you want to override those security privileges
for all functions and use SECURITY DEFINER instead, enable this directive.
.IP USE_TABLESPACE 4
.IX Item "USE_TABLESPACE"
When enabled this directive forces ora2pg to export all tables and
indexes using the tablespace name defined in Oracle database. This works only with
tablespaces that are not TEMP, USERS or SYSTEM.
.IP WITH_OID 4
.IX Item "WITH_OID"
Activating this directive will force Ora2Pg to add WITH (OIDS) when creating
tables or views as tables. Default is same as PostgreSQL, disabled.
.IP LOOK_FORWARD_FUNCTION 4
.IX Item "LOOK_FORWARD_FUNCTION"
List of schemas to get functions/procedures meta information that are used
in the current schema export. When replacing calls to functions with OUT
parameters, if a function is declared in an other package, then the function
call rewriting can not be done because Ora2Pg only knows about functions
declared in the current schema. By setting a comma-separated list of schemas
as value of this directive, Ora2Pg will look forward in these packages for
all functions/procedures/packages declarations before proceeding to current
schema export.
.IP NO_FUNCTION_METADATA 4
.IX Item "NO_FUNCTION_METADATA"
Forces Ora2Pg to not look for function declarations. Note that this will prevent
Ora2Pg from rewriting function replacement calls if needed. Do not enable it unless
looking forward at functions breaks other exports.
.SS "Export type"
.IX Subsection "Export type"
The export action is performed following a single configuration directive 'TYPE',
some others add more control over what should be exported.
.IP TYPE 4
.IX Item "TYPE"
Here are the different values of the TYPE directive, default is TABLE:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&        \- TABLE: Extract all tables with indexes, primary keys, unique keys,
\&          foreign keys and check constraints.
\&        \- VIEW: Extract only views.
\&        \- GRANT: Extract roles converted to Pg groups, users and grants on all
\&          objects.
\&        \- SEQUENCE: Extract all sequences and their last positions.
\&        \- TABLESPACE: Extract storage spaces for tables and indexes (Pg >= v8).
\&        \- TRIGGER: Extract triggers defined on actions.
\&        \- FUNCTION: Extract functions.
\&        \- PROCEDURE: Extract procedures.
\&        \- PACKAGE: Extract packages and package bodies.
\&        \- INSERT: Extract data as INSERT statements.
\&        \- COPY: Extract data as COPY statements.
\&        \- PARTITION: Extract range and list Oracle partitions with subpartitions.
\&        \- TYPE: Extract user defined Oracle types.
\&        \- FDW: Export Oracle tables as foreign tables for Oracle, MySQL and SQL Server FDW.
\&        \- MVIEW: Export materialized views.
\&        \- QUERY: Try to automatically convert Oracle SQL queries.
\&        \- KETTLE: Generate XML ktr template files for use by Kettle.
\&        \- DBLINK: Generate Oracle foreign data wrapper server to use as dblink.
\&        \- SYNONYM: Export Oracle\*(Aqs synonyms as views on other schema\*(Aqs objects.
\&        \- DIRECTORY: Export Oracle\*(Aqs directories as external_file extension objects.
\&        \- LOAD: Dispatch a list of queries over multiple PostgreSQL connections.
\&        \- TEST: Perform a diff between Oracle and PostgreSQL databases.
\&        \- TEST_COUNT: Perform a row count diff between Oracle and PostgreSQL tables.
\&        \- TEST_VIEW: Perform a row count diff between Oracle and PostgreSQL views.
\&        \- TEST_DATA: Perform data validation check on rows on both sides.
\&        \- SEQUENCE_VALUES: Export DDL to set the last values of sequences
.Ve
.Sp
Only one type of export can be performed at a time so the TYPE directive
must be unique. If you have more than one only the last found in the file will
be registered.
.Sp
Some export types cannot or should not be loaded directly into the PostgreSQL
database and still require little manual editing. This is the case for GRANT,
TABLESPACE, TRIGGER, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, TYPE, QUERY and PACKAGE export types
especially if you have PL/SQL code or Oracle specific SQL in them.
.Sp
For TABLESPACE you must ensure that file paths exist on the system and for
SYNONYM you may need to ensure that the object's owners and schemas correspond to
the new PostgreSQL database design.
.Sp
Note that you can chain multiple exports by giving to the TYPE directive a
comma-separated list of export types, but in this case you must not use COPY
or INSERT with other export types.
.Sp
Ora2Pg will convert Oracle partitions using table inheritance, triggers and
functions. See documentation at PostgreSQL:
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/ddl\-partitioning.html
.Sp
The TYPE export allows export of user defined Oracle types. If you don't use the
\&\-\-plsql command line parameter it simply dumps Oracle user type as-is else Ora2Pg
will try to convert it to PostgreSQL syntax.
.Sp
The KETTLE export type requires that the Oracle and PostgreSQL DNS are defined.
.Sp
Since Ora2Pg v8.1 there are three new export types:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        SHOW_VERSION : display Oracle version
\&        SHOW_SCHEMA  : display the list of schemas available in the database.
\&        SHOW_TABLE   : display the list of tables available.
\&        SHOW_COLUMN  : display the list of tables columns available and the
\&                Ora2PG conversion type from Oracle to PostgreSQL that will be
\&                applied. It will also warn you if there are PostgreSQL reserved
\&                words in Oracle object names.
.Ve
.Sp
Here is an example of the SHOW_COLUMN output:
.Sp
.Vb 11
\&        [2] TABLE CURRENT_SCHEMA (1 rows) (Warning: \*(AqCURRENT_SCHEMA\*(Aq is a reserved word in PostgreSQL)
\&                CONSTRAINT : NUMBER(22) => bigint (Warning: \*(AqCONSTRAINT\*(Aq is a reserved word in PostgreSQL)
\&                FREEZE : VARCHAR2(25) => varchar(25) (Warning: \*(AqFREEZE\*(Aq is a reserved word in PostgreSQL)
\&        ...
\&        [6] TABLE LOCATIONS (23 rows)
\&                LOCATION_ID : NUMBER(4) => smallint
\&                STREET_ADDRESS : VARCHAR2(40) => varchar(40)
\&                POSTAL_CODE : VARCHAR2(12) => varchar(12)
\&                CITY : VARCHAR2(30) => varchar(30)
\&                STATE_PROVINCE : VARCHAR2(25) => varchar(25)
\&                COUNTRY_ID : CHAR(2) => char(2)
.Ve
.Sp
These extraction keywords are used to only display the requested information and
exit. This allows you to quickly explore on what you are going to work with.
.Sp
The SHOW_COLUMN allows another ora2pg command line option: '\-\-allow relname'
or '\-a relname' to limit the displayed information to the given table.
.Sp
The SHOW_ENCODING export type will display the NLS_LANG and CLIENT_ENCODING
values that Ora2Pg will use and the real encoding of the Oracle database with
the corresponding client encoding that could be used with PostgreSQL.
.Sp
Ora2Pg allows you to export your Oracle, MySQL or MSSQL table definitions to
be used with the oracle_fdw, mysql_fdw or tds_fdw foreign data wrapper. By using
type FDW your tables will be exported as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        CREATE FOREIGN TABLE oratab (
\&                id        integer           NOT NULL,
\&                text      character varying(30),
\&                floating  double precision  NOT NULL
\&        ) SERVER oradb OPTIONS (table \*(AqORATAB\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
Now you can use the table like a regular PostgreSQL table.
.Sp
Release 10 adds a new export type designed to evaluate the content of the
database to migrate, in terms of objects and cost to complete the migration:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SHOW_REPORT  : show a detailed report of the Oracle database content.
.Ve
.Sp
Here is a sample report: http://ora2pg.darold.net/report.html
.Sp
There is also a more advanced report with migration cost. See the dedicated chapter
about Migration Cost Evaluation.
.IP ESTIMATE_COST 4
.IX Item "ESTIMATE_COST"
Activate the migration cost evaluation. Must only be used with SHOW_REPORT,
FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, PACKAGE and QUERY export types. Default is disabled.
You may want to use the \-\-estimate_cost command line option instead to activate
this functionality. Note that enabling this directive will force PLSQL_PGSQL
activation.
.IP COST_UNIT_VALUE 4
.IX Item "COST_UNIT_VALUE"
Sets the value in minutes of the migration cost evaluation unit. Default
is five minutes per unit. See \-\-cost_unit_value to change the unit value
at command line.
.IP DUMP_AS_HTML 4
.IX Item "DUMP_AS_HTML"
By default when using SHOW_REPORT the migration report is generated as simple
text. Enabling this directive will force ora2pg to create a report in HTML
format.
.Sp
See http://ora2pg.darold.net/report.html for a sample report.
.IP DUMP_AS_JSON 4
.IX Item "DUMP_AS_JSON"
By default when using SHOW_REPORT the migration report is generated as simple
text. Enabling this directive will force ora2pg to create a report in JSON
format.
.Sp
See http://ora2pg.darold.net/report.html for a sample report.
.IP DUMP_AS_CSV 4
.IX Item "DUMP_AS_CSV"
By default when using SHOW_REPORT the migration report is generated as simple
text, enabling this directive will force ora2pg to create a report in CSV
format.
.Sp
See http://ora2pg.darold.net/report.html for a sample report.
.IP DUMP_AS_FILE_PREFIX 4
.IX Item "DUMP_AS_FILE_PREFIX"
By default when using SHOW_REPORT the migration report is generated to stout.
Enabling this directive in conjunction with DUMP_AS_* directives will force
ora2pg to create a report files with the given extensions and formats. This
option allows you to combine multiple DUMP_AS_* formats.
.Sp
See http://ora2pg.darold.net/report.html for a sample report.
.IP HUMAN_DAYS_LIMIT 4
.IX Item "HUMAN_DAYS_LIMIT"
Use this directive to redefine the number of person-days limit where the
migration assessment level must switch from B to C. Default is set to 10
person-days.
.IP JOBS 4
.IX Item "JOBS"
This configuration directive adds multiprocess support to COPY, FUNCTION
and PROCEDURE export types. The value is the number of processes to use.
Default is to disable multiprocessing.
.Sp
This directive is used to set the number of cores to use to parallelize
data import into PostgreSQL. During FUNCTION or PROCEDURE export type each
function will be translated to plpgsql using a new process. The performance
gain can be very important when you have tons of functions to convert.
.Sp
There's no limitation in parallel processing other than the number of cores
and the PostgreSQL I/O performance capabilities.
.Sp
Doesn't work under Windows Operating System, it is simply disabled.
.IP ORACLE_COPIES 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_COPIES"
This configuration directive adds multiprocess support to extract data
from Oracle. The value is the number of processes to use to parallelize
the select query. Default is parallel query disabled.
.Sp
The parallelism is built on splitting the query following the number
of cores given as value to ORACLE_COPIES as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SELECT * FROM MYTABLE WHERE ABS(MOD(COLUMN, ORACLE_COPIES)) = CUR_PROC
.Ve
.Sp
where COLUMN is a technical key like a primary or unique key where split
will be based and the current core used by the query (CUR_PROC). You can
also force the column name to use using the DEFINED_PK configuration directive.
.Sp
Doesn't work under Windows Operating System, it is simply disabled.
.IP DEFINED_PK 4
.IX Item "DEFINED_PK"
This directive is used to define the technical key to use to split
the query between number of cores set with the ORACLE_COPIES variable.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        DEFINED_PK      EMPLOYEES:employee_id
.Ve
.Sp
The parallel query that will be used supposing that \-J or ORACLE_COPIES
is set to 8:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEES WHERE ABS(MOD(employee_id, 8)) = N
.Ve
.Sp
where N is the current process forked starting from 0.
.IP PARALLEL_TABLES 4
.IX Item "PARALLEL_TABLES"
This directive is used to define the number of tables that will be processed
in parallel for data extraction. The limit is the number of cores on your machine.
Ora2Pg will open one database connection for each parallel table extraction.
This directive, when higher than 1, will invalidate ORACLE_COPIES but not JOBS,
so the real number of processes that will be used is PARALLEL_TABLES * JOBS.
.Sp
Note that this directive when set higher than 1 will also automatically enable
the FILE_PER_TABLE directive if you are exporting to files. This is used to
export tables and views in separate files.
.Sp
Use PARALLEL_TABLES to use parallelism with COPY, INSERT and TEST_DATA actions.
It is also useful with TEST, TEST_COUNT, and SHOW_TABLE if \-\-count_rows is
used for real row count.
.IP DEFAULT_PARALLELISM_DEGREE 4
.IX Item "DEFAULT_PARALLELISM_DEGREE"
You can force Ora2Pg to use /*+ PARALLEL(tbname, degree) */ hint in each
query used to export data from Oracle by setting a value higher than 1 to
this directive. A value of 0 or 1 disables the use of parallel hint.
Default is disabled.
.IP FDW_SERVER 4
.IX Item "FDW_SERVER"
This directive is used to set the name of the foreign data server that is used
in the "CREATE SERVER name FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER <fdw_extension> ..." command.
This name will then be used in the "CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ..." SQL commands and
to import data using oracle_fdw. By default, no foreign server is defined.
This only concerns export types FDW, COPY and INSERT. For export type FDW, the
default value is orcl.
.IP FDW_IMPORT_SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "FDW_IMPORT_SCHEMA"
Schema where foreign tables for data migration will be created. If you use
several instances of ora2pg for data migration through the foreign data
wrapper, you might need to change the name of the schema for each instance.
Default: ora2pg_fdw_import
.IP ORACLE_FDW_PREFETCH 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_FDW_PREFETCH"
The default behavior of Ora2Pg is to NOT set the "prefetch" option for
oracle_fdw when used for COPY and INSERT. This directive allows the prefetch to
be set. See oracle_fdw documentation for the current default.
.IP ORACLE_FDW_COPY_MODE 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_FDW_COPY_MODE"
When using Ora2Pg COPY with oracle_fdw, it is possible to use two different
modes: 1) "local", which uses psql on the host running Ora2Pg for the "TO"
binary stream; 2) "server", which uses PostgreSQL server-side COPY for the "TO"
binary stream. Both modes use psql for the "FROM STDIN BINARY". However,
"local" runs the psql "FROM STDIN BINARY" on the host Ora2Pg is run from, whereas
"server" runs the psql "FROM STDIN BINARY" on the PostgreSQL server. "local"
mode should work on any PostgreSQL-based system, including managed offerings,
which are not expected to support use of "server" mode due to permissions. The
default is "local" as this is compatible with more configurations.
.IP ORACLE_FDW_COPY_FORMAT 4
.IX Item "ORACLE_FDW_COPY_FORMAT"
When using Ora2Pg COPY with oracle_fdw, it is possible to use either BINARY or
CSV data format. BINARY provides better performance, however, requires exact
data type matching between the FDW and destination table. CSV provides greater
flexibility with respect to data type matching: if the FDW and destination
data types are functionally-compatible, the columns can be copied. The default
is "binary".
.IP DROP_FOREIGN_SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "DROP_FOREIGN_SCHEMA"
By default, Ora2Pg drops the temporary schema ora2pg_fdw_import used to import
the Oracle foreign schema before each new import. If you want to preserve
the existing schema because of modifications or the use of a third-party
server, disable this directive.
.IP EXTERNAL_TO_FDW 4
.IX Item "EXTERNAL_TO_FDW"
This directive, enabled by default, allows exporting Oracle's External Tables as
file_fdw foreign tables. To not export these tables at all, set the directive
to 0.
.IP INTERNAL_DATE_MAX 4
.IX Item "INTERNAL_DATE_MAX"
Internal timestamps retrieved from custom types are extracted in the following
format: 01\-JAN\-77 12.00.00.000000 AM. It is impossible to know the exact century
that must be used, so by default any year below 49 will be added to 2000
and others to 1900. You can use this directive to change the default value 49.
This is only relevant if you have a user-defined type with a timestamp column.
.IP AUDIT_USER 4
.IX Item "AUDIT_USER"
Set the comma-separated list of usernames that must be used to filter
queries from the DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL table. Default is to not scan this
table and to never look for queries. This parameter is used only with
SHOW_REPORT and QUERY export type with no input file for queries.
Note that queries will be normalized before output unlike when a file
is given at input using the \-i option or INPUT directive.
.IP FUNCTION_CHECK 4
.IX Item "FUNCTION_CHECK"
Disable this directive if you want to disable check_function_bodies.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SET check_function_bodies = false;
.Ve
.Sp
It disables validation of the function body string during CREATE FUNCTION.
Default is to use the postgresql.conf setting, which enables it by default.
.IP ENABLE_BLOB_EXPORT 4
.IX Item "ENABLE_BLOB_EXPORT"
Exporting BLOBs takes time; in some circumstances you may want to export
all data except the BLOB columns. In this case, disable this directive and
the BLOB columns will not be included into data export. Take care that the
target bytea column does not have a NOT NULL constraint.
.IP ENABLE_CLOB_EXPORT 4
.IX Item "ENABLE_CLOB_EXPORT"
Same behavior as ENABLE_BLOB_EXPORT but for CLOB.
.IP DATA_EXPORT_ORDER 4
.IX Item "DATA_EXPORT_ORDER"
By default, data export order will be done by sorting on table name. If you
have huge tables at the end of alphabetic order and you are using multiprocess,
it can be better to set the sort order on size so that multiple small tables
can be processed before the largest tables finish. In this case set this
directive to size. Possible values are name and size. Note that export types
SHOW_TABLE and SHOW_COLUMN will use this sort order too, not only COPY or
INSERT export type. If you want to give your custom export order, just give
a filename as value that contains the ordered list tables to export. Must
be a list of one table per line, in uppercase for Oracle.
.SS "Limiting objects to export"
.IX Subsection "Limiting objects to export"
You may want to export only a part of an Oracle database. Here is a set of
configuration directives that will allow you to control which parts of the
database should be exported.
.IP ALLOW 4
.IX Item "ALLOW"
This directive allows you to set a list of objects to which the export must be
limited, excluding all other objects of the same type of export. The value is
a space or comma-separated list of object names to export. You can include
valid regex into the list. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ALLOW           EMPLOYEES SALE_.* COUNTRIES .*_GEOM_SEQ
.Ve
.Sp
will export objects with names EMPLOYEES, COUNTRIES, all objects beginning with
\&'SALE_' and all objects with a name ending in '_GEOM_SEQ'. The object depends
of the export type. Note that regex will not work with 8i database, you must
use the % placeholder instead, Ora2Pg will use the LIKE operator.
.Sp
This is the way to declare global filters that will be used with the current
export type. You can also use extended filters that will be applied to specific
objects or only on their related export type. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-p \-c ora2pg.conf \-t TRIGGER \-a \*(AqTABLE[employees]\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
will limit export of triggers to those defined on table employees. If you want
to extract all triggers but not some INSTEAD OF triggers:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-c ora2pg.conf \-t TRIGGER \-e \*(AqVIEW[trg_view_.*]\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
Or a more complex form:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        ora2pg \-p \-c ora2pg.conf \-t TABLE \-a \*(AqTABLE[EMPLOYEES]\*(Aq \e
\&                \-e \*(AqINDEX[emp_.*];CKEY[emp_salary_min]\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
This command will export the definition of the employee table but will exclude
all indexes beginning with 'emp_' and the CHECK constraint called 'emp_salary_min'.
.Sp
When exporting partitions you can exclude some partition tables by using
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-p \-c ora2pg.conf \-t PARTITION \-e \*(AqPARTITION[PART_199.* PART_198.*]\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
This will exclude partitioned tables for years 1980 to 1999 from the export but
not the main partition table. The trigger will also be adapted to exclude those
tables.
.Sp
With GRANT export you can use this extended form to exclude some users from the
export or limit the export to some others:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-p \-c ora2pg.conf \-t GRANT \-a \*(AqUSER1 USER2\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-p \-c ora2pg.conf \-t GRANT \-a \*(AqGRANT[USER1 USER2]\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
will limit export grants to users USER1 and USER2. But if you don't want to
export grants on some functions for these users, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-p \-c ora2pg.conf \-t GRANT \-a \*(AqUSER1 USER2\*(Aq \-e \*(AqFUNCTION[adm_.*];PROCEDURE[adm_.*]\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
Advanced filters may need some learning.
.Sp
Oracle doesn't allow the use of lookahead expressions so you may want to exclude
some objects that match the ALLOW regexp you have defined. For example if you
want to export all tables starting with E but not those starting with EXP it is
not possible to do that in a single expression. This is why you can start a
regular expression with the ! character to exclude objects matching the regexp
given just after. Our previous example can be written as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ALLOW   E.* !EXP.*
.Ve
.Sp
it will be translated into:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&         REGEXP_LIKE(..., \*(Aq^E.*$\*(Aq) AND NOT REGEXP_LIKE(..., \*(Aq^EXP.*$\*(Aq)
.Ve
.Sp
in the object search expression.
.IP EXCLUDE 4
.IX Item "EXCLUDE"
This directive is the opposite of the previous. It allows you to define a space
or comma-separated list of object names to exclude from the export. You can
include valid regex in the list. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXCLUDE         EMPLOYEES TMP_.* COUNTRIES
.Ve
.Sp
will exclude objects with names EMPLOYEES, COUNTRIES and all tables beginning with
\&'tmp_'.
.Sp
For example, you can ban some unwanted functions from export with this directive:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXCLUDE         write_to_.* send_mail_.*
.Ve
.Sp
This example will exclude all functions, procedures or functions in a package
with names beginning with those regex. Note that regex will not work with
8i database, you must use the % placeholder instead, Ora2Pg will use the NOT
LIKE operator.
.Sp
See above (directive 'ALLOW') for the extended syntax.
.IP NO_EXCLUDED_TABLE 4
.IX Item "NO_EXCLUDED_TABLE"
By default, Ora2Pg excludes from export some Oracle "garbage" tables from export that should
never be part of an export. This behavior generates a lot of REGEXP_LIKE
expressions which slow down the export when looking at tables. To disable
this behavior enable this directive, you will have to exclude or clean up later
by yourself the unwanted tables. The regexps used to exclude the tables are
defined in the array \f(CW@EXCLUDED_TABLES\fR in lib/Ora2Pg.pm. Note this behavior
is independent of the EXCLUDE configuration directive.
.IP VIEW_AS_TABLE 4
.IX Item "VIEW_AS_TABLE"
Set which views to export as tables. By default none. Value must be a list of
view names or regexps separated by space or comma. If the object name is a view
and the export type is TABLE, the view will be exported as a create table
statement. If export type is COPY or INSERT, the corresponding data will be
exported.
.Sp
See chapter "Exporting views as PostgreSQL table" for more details.
.IP MVIEW_AS_TABLE 4
.IX Item "MVIEW_AS_TABLE"
Set which materialized views to export as tables. By default none. Value must be
a list of materialized view names or regexps separated by space or comma. If the
object name is a materialized view and the export type is TABLE, the view will
be exported as a create table statement. If export type is COPY or INSERT, the
corresponding data will be exported.
.IP NO_VIEW_ORDERING 4
.IX Item "NO_VIEW_ORDERING"
By default, Ora2Pg tries to order views to avoid errors at import time with
nested views. With a huge number of views this can take a very long time,
you can bypass this ordering by enabling this directive.
.IP GRANT_OBJECT 4
.IX Item "GRANT_OBJECT"
When exporting GRANTs you can specify a comma separated list of objects
for which privileges will be exported. Default is export for all objects.
Here are the possible values: TABLE, VIEW, MATERIALIZED VIEW, SEQUENCE,
PROCEDURE, FUNCTION, PACKAGE BODY, TYPE, SYNONYM, DIRECTORY. Only one object
type is allowed at a time. For example set it to TABLE if you just want to
export privileges on tables. You can use the \-g option to overwrite it.
.Sp
When used this directive prevents the export of users unless it is set to USER.
In this case only user definitions are exported.
.IP WHERE 4
.IX Item "WHERE"
This directive allows you to specify a WHERE clause filter when dumping the
contents of tables. The value is constructed as follows: TABLE_NAME[WHERE_CLAUSE],
or if you have only one where clause for all tables just put the where clause
as the value. Both are possible too. Here are some examples:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        # Global where clause applying to all tables included in the export
\&        WHERE  1=1
\&
\&        # Apply the where clause only on table TABLE_NAME
\&        WHERE  TABLE_NAME[ID1=\*(Aq001\*(Aq]
\&
\&        # Applies two different clauses on tables TABLE_NAME and OTHER_TABLE
\&        # and a generic where clause on DATE_CREATE to all other tables
\&        WHERE  TABLE_NAME[ID1=\*(Aq001\*(Aq OR ID1=\*(Aq002] DATE_CREATE > \*(Aq2001\-01\-01\*(Aq OTHER_TABLE[NAME=\*(Aqtest\*(Aq]
.Ve
.Sp
Any WHERE clause not included in a table name bracket clause will be applied
to all exported tables including the tables defined in the WHERE clause. These
WHERE clauses are very useful if you want to archive some data or
only export some recent data.
.Sp
To be able to quickly test data import it is useful to limit data export to the
first thousand tuples of each table. For Oracle define the following clause:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        WHERE   ROWNUM < 1000
.Ve
.Sp
and for MySQL, use the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        WHERE   1=1 LIMIT 1,1000
.Ve
.Sp
This can also be restricted to some tables' data export.
.Sp
Command line option \-W or \-\-where will override this directive for the global
part and per table if the table names are the same.
.IP TOP_MAX 4
.IX Item "TOP_MAX"
This directive is used to limit the number of items shown in the top N lists
like the top list of tables per number of rows and the top list of largest
tables in megabytes. By default it is set to 10 items.
.IP LOG_ON_ERROR 4
.IX Item "LOG_ON_ERROR"
Enable this directive if you want to continue direct data import on error.
When Ora2Pg receives an error in the COPY or INSERT statement from PostgreSQL
it will log the statement to a file called TABLENAME_error.log in the output
directory and continue to next bulk of data. Like this you can try to fix the
statement and manually reload the error log file. Default is disabled: abort
import on error.
.IP REPLACE_QUERY 4
.IX Item "REPLACE_QUERY"
Sometimes you may want to extract data from an Oracle table but you need a
custom query for that. Not just a "SELECT * FROM table" like Ora2Pg does
but a more complex query. This directive allows you to overwrite the query
used by Ora2Pg to extract data. The format is TABLENAME[SQL_QUERY].
If you have multiple tables to extract by replacing the Ora2Pg query, you can
define multiple REPLACE_QUERY lines.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_QUERY   EMPLOYEES[SELECT e.id,e.firstname,lastname FROM EMPLOYEES e JOIN EMP_UPDT u ON (e.id=u.id AND u.cdate>\*(Aq2014\-08\-01 00:00:00\*(Aq)]
.Ve
.SS "Control of Full Text Search export"
.IX Subsection "Control of Full Text Search export"
Several directives can be used to control how Ora2Pg exports the
Oracle's Text search indexes. By default, CONTEXT indexes will be exported
to PostgreSQL FTS indexes, while CTXCAT indexes will be exported as indexes
using the pg_trgm extension.
.IP CONTEXT_AS_TRGM 4
.IX Item "CONTEXT_AS_TRGM"
Forces Ora2Pg to translate Oracle Text indexes into PostgreSQL indexes using
the pg_trgm extension. By default, CONTEXT indexes are translated into FTS indexes
and CTXCAT indexes use pg_trgm. Most of the time using pg_trgm is sufficient, which
is why this directive exists. You need to create the pg_trgm extension
in the destination database before importing the objects:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;
.Ve
.IP FTS_INDEX_ONLY 4
.IX Item "FTS_INDEX_ONLY"
By default, Ora2Pg creates a function-based index to translate Oracle Text
indexes:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        CREATE INDEX ON t_document
\&                USING gin(to_tsvector(\*(Aqpg_catalog.french\*(Aq, title));
.Ve
.Sp
You will have to rewrite the \fBCONTAINS()\fR clause using \fBto_tsvector()\fR, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        SELECT id,title FROM t_document
\&                WHERE to_tsvector(title) @@ to_tsquery(\*(Aqsearch_word\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
To force Ora2Pg to create an extra tsvector column with dedicated triggers
for FTS indexes, disable this directive. In this case, Ora2Pg will add the
column as follows: ALTER TABLE t_document ADD COLUMN tsv_title tsvector;
Then update the column to compute FTS vectors if data have been loaded before:
	    UPDATE t_document SET tsv_title =
		to_tsvector('pg_catalog.french', coalesce(title,''));
To automatically update the column when a modification in the title column
occurs, Ora2Pg adds the following trigger:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        CREATE FUNCTION tsv_t_document_title() RETURNS trigger AS $$
\&        BEGIN
\&               IF TG_OP = \*(AqINSERT\*(Aq OR new.title != old.title THEN
\&                       new.tsv_title :=
\&                       to_tsvector(\*(Aqpg_catalog.french\*(Aq, coalesce(new.title,\*(Aq\*(Aq));
\&               END IF;
\&               return new;
\&        END
\&        $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
\&        CREATE TRIGGER trig_tsv_t_document_title BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE
\&         ON t_document
\&         FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE tsv_t_document_title();
.Ve
.Sp
When the Oracle text index is defined over multiple columns, Ora2Pg will use
\&\fBsetweight()\fR to set weights in the order of the column declarations.
.IP FTS_CONFIG 4
.IX Item "FTS_CONFIG"
Use this directive to force which text search configuration to use. When it is not
set, Ora2Pg will autodetect the stemmer used by Oracle for each index and
use pg_catalog.english if the information is not found.
.IP USE_UNACCENT 4
.IX Item "USE_UNACCENT"
If you want to perform text searches in an accent-insensitive way, enable
this directive. Ora2Pg will create a helper function using \fBunaccent()\fR and
create the pg_trgm indexes using this function. With FTS, Ora2Pg will
redefine your text search configuration, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&      CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION fr (COPY = french); 
\&      ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION fr
\&              ALTER MAPPING FOR hword, hword_part, word WITH unaccent, french_stem;
.Ve
.Sp
then set the FTS_CONFIG ora2pg.conf directive to fr instead of pg_catalog.english.
.Sp
When enabled, Ora2pg will create the wrapper function:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION unaccent_immutable(text)
\&      RETURNS text AS
\&      $$
\&          SELECT public.unaccent(\*(Aqpublic.unaccent\*(Aq, $1);
\&      $$ LANGUAGE sql IMMUTABLE
\&         COST 1;
.Ve
.Sp
The indexes are exported as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&      CREATE INDEX t_document_title_unaccent_trgm_idx ON t_document 
\&          USING gin (unaccent_immutable(title) gin_trgm_ops);
.Ve
.Sp
In your queries, you will need to use the same function in the search to
be able to use the function-based index. Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        SELECT * FROM t_document
\&                WHERE unaccent_immutable(title) LIKE \*(Aq%donnees%\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP USE_LOWER_UNACCENT 4
.IX Item "USE_LOWER_UNACCENT"
Same as above but calls \fBlower()\fR in the \fBunaccent_immutable()\fR function:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&      CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION unaccent_immutable(text)
\&      RETURNS text AS
\&      $$
\&          SELECT lower(public.unaccent(\*(Aqpublic.unaccent\*(Aq, $1));
\&      $$ LANGUAGE sql IMMUTABLE;
.Ve
.SS "Modifying object structure"
.IX Subsection "Modifying object structure"
One of the great uses of Ora2Pg is its flexibility to replicate an Oracle database
into a PostgreSQL database with a different structure or schema. There are three
configuration directives that allow you to map these differences.
.IP REORDERING_COLUMNS 4
.IX Item "REORDERING_COLUMNS"
Enable this directive to reorder columns and minimize the footprint
on disk, so that more rows fit on a data page, which is the most important
factor for speed. Default is disabled, meaning the same order as in
Oracle tables definition, which should be enough for most uses. This
directive is only used with TABLE export.
.IP MODIFY_STRUCT 4
.IX Item "MODIFY_STRUCT"
This directive allows you to limit the columns to extract for a given table. The
value consists of a space-separated list of table names with a set of columns
between parentheses as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        MODIFY_STRUCT   TABLE_NAME(colname1,colname2,...) ...
.Ve
.Sp
for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        MODIFY_STRUCT   T_TEST1(id,dossier) T_TEST2(id,fichier)
.Ve
.Sp
This will only extract columns 'id' and 'dossier' from table T_TEST1 and columns
\&'id' and 'fichier' from the T_TEST2 table. This directive can only be used with
TABLE, COPY or INSERT export. With TABLE export create table DDL will respect
the new list of columns and all indexes or foreign keys pointing to or from a
removed column will not be exported.
.IP EXCLUDE_COLUMNS 4
.IX Item "EXCLUDE_COLUMNS"
Instead of redefining the table structure with MODIFY_STRUCT you may want
to exclude some columns from the table export. The value consists of a
space-separated list of table names with a set of column between parentheses
as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXCLUDE_COLUMNS TABLE_NAME(colname1,colname2,...) ...
.Ve
.Sp
for example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        EXCLUDE_COLUMNS T_TEST1(id,dossier) T_TEST2(id,fichier)
.Ve
.Sp
This will exclude columns 'id' and 'dossier' from table T_TEST1
and columns 'id' and 'fichier' from the T_TEST2 table from the export. This directive can only
be used with TABLE, COPY or INSERT export. With TABLE export create table DDL
will respect the new list of columns and all indexes or foreign keys pointing
to or from a removed column will not be exported.
.IP REPLACE_TABLES 4
.IX Item "REPLACE_TABLES"
This directive allows you to remap a list of Oracle table names to a PostgreSQL table names during export. The value is a list of space-separated values with the following structure:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_TABLES  ORIG_TBNAME1:DEST_TBNAME1 ORIG_TBNAME2:DEST_TBNAME2
.Ve
.Sp
Oracle tables ORIG_TBNAME1 and ORIG_TBNAME2 will be respectively renamed to
DEST_TBNAME1 and DEST_TBNAME2
.IP REPLACE_COLS 4
.IX Item "REPLACE_COLS"
Like table names, column names can be remapped to different names
using the following syntax:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_COLS    ORIG_TBNAME(ORIG_COLNAME1:NEW_COLNAME1,ORIG_COLNAME2:NEW_COLNAME2)
.Ve
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_COLS    T_TEST(dico:dictionary,dossier:folder)
.Ve
.Sp
will rename Oracle columns 'dico' and 'dossier' from table T_TEST to new names
\&'dictionary' and 'folder'.
.IP REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN 4
.IX Item "REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN"
If you want to change the type of some Oracle columns to PostgreSQL boolean
during the export you can define here a list of tables and columns separated by
spaces as follows.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN     TB_NAME1:COL_NAME1 TB_NAME1:COL_NAME2 TB_NAME2:COL_NAME2
.Ve
.Sp
The values set in the boolean columns list will be replaced with 't' and 'f'
following the default replacement values and those additionally set in directive
BOOLEAN_VALUES.
.Sp
Note that if you have modified the table name with REPLACE_TABLES and/or the
column's name, you need to use the name of the original table and/or column.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        REPLACE_COLS            TB_NAME1(OLD_COL_NAME1:NEW_COL_NAME1)
\&        REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN      TB_NAME1:OLD_COL_NAME1
.Ve
.Sp
You can also give a type and precision to automatically convert all fields of
that type to boolean. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        REPLACE_AS_BOOLEAN      NUMBER:1 CHAR:1 TB_NAME1:COL_NAME1 TB_NAME1:COL_NAME2
.Ve
.Sp
will also replace any field of type \fBnumber\fR\|(1) or \fBchar\fR\|(1) as a boolean in all exported
tables.
.IP BOOLEAN_VALUES 4
.IX Item "BOOLEAN_VALUES"
Use this to add additional definitions of the possible boolean values used in
Oracle fields. You must set a space-separated list of TRUE:FALSE values. By
default, here are the values recognized by Ora2Pg:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        BOOLEAN_VALUES          yes:no y:n 1:0 true:false enabled:disabled
.Ve
.Sp
Any values defined here will be added to the default list.
.IP REPLACE_ZERO_DATE 4
.IX Item "REPLACE_ZERO_DATE"
When Ora2Pg finds a "zero" date: 0000\-00\-00 00:00:00 it is replaced by a NULL.
This could be a problem if your column is defined with a NOT NULL constraint.
If you can not remove the constraint, use this directive to set an arbitrary
date that will be used instead. You can also use \-INFINITY if you don't want
to use a fake date.
.IP INDEXES_SUFFIX 4
.IX Item "INDEXES_SUFFIX"
Add the given value as suffix to index names. Useful if you have indexes
with the same name as tables. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        INDEXES_SUFFIX          _idx
.Ve
.Sp
will add _idx at the end of all index names. Not very common but helpful.
.IP INDEXES_RENAMING 4
.IX Item "INDEXES_RENAMING"
Enable this directive to rename all indexes using tablename_columns_names.
Could be very useful for databases that have multiple instances of the same index name
or that use the same name as a table, which is not allowed by PostgreSQL.
Disabled by default.
.IP USE_INDEX_OPCLASS 4
.IX Item "USE_INDEX_OPCLASS"
Operator classes text_pattern_ops, varchar_pattern_ops, and bpchar_pattern_ops
support B\-tree indexes on the corresponding types. The difference from the
default operator classes is that the values are compared strictly character by
character rather than according to locale-specific collation rules. This
makes these operator classes suitable for use by queries involving pattern
matching expressions (LIKE or POSIX regular expressions) when the database
does not use the standard "C" locale. If enabled with value 1, this will
force Ora2Pg to export all indexes defined on \fBvarchar2()\fR and \fBchar()\fR columns
using those operators. If you set it to a value greater than 1, it will only
change indexes on columns where the character limit is greater than or equal to
this value. For example, set it to 128 to create these kinds of indexes on
columns of type varchar2(N) where N >= 128.
.IP RENAME_PARTITION 4
.IX Item "RENAME_PARTITION"
Enable this directive if you want your partition tables to be renamed.
Disabled by default. If you have multiple partitioned tables, when exported to
PostgreSQL some partitions could have the same name but different parent tables.
This is not allowed \- table names must be unique. In this case, enable this
directive. A partition will be renamed following the rule:
    "tablename"_part"pos"
where "pos" is the partition number. For subpartition this is:
    "tablename"_part"pos"_subpart"pos"
If this is partition/subpartition default:
    "tablename"_part_default
    "tablename"_part"pos"_subpart_default
.IP DISABLE_PARTITION 4
.IX Item "DISABLE_PARTITION"
If you don't want to reproduce the partitioning like in Oracle and want to
export all partitioned Oracle data into the main single table in PostgreSQL,
enable this directive. Ora2Pg will export all data into the main table name.
Default is to use partitioning \- Ora2Pg will export data from each partition
and import them into the PostgreSQL dedicated partition table.
.IP PARTITION_BY_REFERENCE 4
.IX Item "PARTITION_BY_REFERENCE"
How to export partition by reference. Possible values are none, duplicate or
the number of hash partitions to create. Default is none to not export the
partitions by reference.
.Sp
Value 'none' means no translation and export of partition by reference like
before. Value 'duplicate' will duplicate the referenced column in the
partitioned table and apply the same partitioning from the referenced table
to the partitioned table. If the value is a number, the table will be
partitioned with the HASH method using the value as the modulo. For example,
if you set it to 4 it will create 4 HASH partitions.
.IP DISABLE_UNLOGGED 4
.IX Item "DISABLE_UNLOGGED"
By default, Ora2Pg exports Oracle tables with the NOLOGGING attribute as
UNLOGGED tables. You may want to fully disable this feature because
you will lose all data from unlogged tables in case of a PostgreSQL crash.
Set it to 1 to export all tables as normal tables.
.IP DOUBLE_MAX_VARCHAR 4
.IX Item "DOUBLE_MAX_VARCHAR"
Increase varchar max character constraints to support PostgreSQL two bytes
character encoding when the source database applies the length constraint
on characters not bytes. Default disabled.
.SS "Oracle Spatial to PostGIS"
.IX Subsection "Oracle Spatial to PostGIS"
Ora2Pg fully exports Spatial objects from Oracle database. There are some
configuration directives that can be used to control the export.
.IP AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE 4
.IX Item "AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE"
By default, Ora2Pg looks at indexes to see the spatial constraint type
and dimensions defined under Oracle. Those constraints are passed at index
creation using for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        CREATE INDEX ... INDEXTYPE IS MDSYS.SPATIAL_INDEX
\&        PARAMETERS(\*(Aqsdo_indx_dims=2, layer_gtype=point\*(Aq);
.Ve
.Sp
If those Oracle constraint parameters are not set, the default is to export
those columns as generic type GEOMETRY to be able to receive any spatial type.
.Sp
The AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE directive allows Ora2Pg to autodetect the
real spatial type and dimension used in a spatial column; otherwise a non\-
constrained "geometry" type is used. Enabling this feature will force Ora2Pg to
scan a sample of 50,000 columns to look at the GTYPE used. You can increase or
reduce the sample size by setting the value of AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE to the
desired number of lines to scan. The directive is enabled by default.
.Sp
For example, in the case of a column named shape and defined with Oracle type
SDO_GEOMETRY, with AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE disabled it will be converted as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    shape geometry(GEOMETRY) or shape geometry(GEOMETRYZ, 4326)
.Ve
.Sp
and if the directive is enabled and the column just contains a single
geometry type that uses a single dimension:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    shape geometry(POLYGON, 4326) or shape geometry(POLYGONZ, 4326)
.Ve
.Sp
with a two or three dimensional polygon.
.IP CONVERT_SRID 4
.IX Item "CONVERT_SRID"
This directive allows you to control the automatic conversion of Oracle
SRID to standard EPSG. If enabled, Ora2Pg will use the Oracle function
sdo_cs.\fBmap_oracle_srid_to_epsg()\fR to convert all SRIDs. Enabled by default.
.Sp
If the SDO_SRID returned by Oracle is NULL, it will be replaced by the
default value 8307 converted to its EPSG value: 4326 (see DEFAULT_SRID).
.Sp
If the value is higher than 1, all SRIDs will be forced to this value. In
this case, DEFAULT_SRID will not be used when Oracle returns a null value,
and the value will be forced to CONVERT_SRID.
.Sp
Note that it is also possible to set the EPSG value on the Oracle side when
sdo_cs.\fBmap_oracle_srid_to_epsg()\fR returns NULL if you want to force the value:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  system@db> UPDATE sdo_coord_ref_sys SET legacy_code=41014 WHERE srid = 27572;
.Ve
.IP DEFAULT_SRID 4
.IX Item "DEFAULT_SRID"
Use this directive to override the default EPSG SRID to use: 4326.
Can be overwritten by CONVERT_SRID, see above.
.IP GEOMETRY_EXTRACT_TYPE 4
.IX Item "GEOMETRY_EXTRACT_TYPE"
This directive can take three values: WKT (default), WKB and INTERNAL.
When it is set to WKT, Ora2Pg will use SDO_UTIL.\fBTO_WKTGEOMETRY()\fR to
extract the geometry data. When it is set to WKB, Ora2Pg will use the
binary output using SDO_UTIL.\fBTO_WKBGEOMETRY()\fR. If these two extract types
are called at the Oracle side, they are slow and you can easily reach Out Of
Memory when you have lots of rows. Also, WKB is not able to export 3D geometry
and some geometries like CURVEPOLYGON. In this case, you may use the INTERNAL
extraction type. It will use a Pure Perl library to convert the SDO_GEOMETRY
data into a WKT representation, the translation is done on Ora2Pg side.
This is a work in progress, please validate your exported data geometries
before use. Default spatial object extraction type is INTERNAL.
.IP POSTGIS_SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "POSTGIS_SCHEMA"
Use this directive to add a specific schema to the search path to look
for PostGIS functions.
.IP ST_SRID_FUNCTION 4
.IX Item "ST_SRID_FUNCTION"
Oracle function to use to extract the SRID from ST_Geometry meta information.
Default: ST_SRID, for example it should be set to sde.st_srid for ArcSDE.
.IP ST_DIMENSION_FUNCTION 4
.IX Item "ST_DIMENSION_FUNCTION"
Oracle function to use to extract the dimension from ST_Geometry meta
information. Default: ST_DIMENSION, for example it should be set to
sde.st_dimension for ArcSDE.
.IP ST_GEOMETRYTYPE_FUNCTION 4
.IX Item "ST_GEOMETRYTYPE_FUNCTION"
Oracle function to use to extract the geometry type from an ST_Geometry column.
Default: ST_GEOMETRYTYPE, for example it should be set to sde.st_geometrytype
for ArcSDE.
.IP ST_ASBINARY_FUNCTION 4
.IX Item "ST_ASBINARY_FUNCTION"
Oracle function used to convert an ST_Geometry value into WKB format.
Default: ST_ASBINARY, for example it should be set to sde.st_asbinary for
ArcSDE.
.IP ST_ASTEXT_FUNCTION 4
.IX Item "ST_ASTEXT_FUNCTION"
Oracle function used to convert an ST_Geometry value into WKT format.
Default: ST_ASTEXT, for example it should be set to sde.st_astext for
ArcSDE.
.SS "PostgreSQL Import"
.IX Subsection "PostgreSQL Import"
By default, conversion to PostgreSQL format is written to a file named 'output.sql'.
The command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        psql mydb < output.sql
.Ve
.PP
will import the contents of file output.sql into the PostgreSQL mydb database.
.IP DATA_LIMIT 4
.IX Item "DATA_LIMIT"
When performing INSERT/COPY export, Ora2Pg processes data in chunks of DATA_LIMIT
tuples for speed improvement. Tuples are stored in memory before being written
to disk, so if you want speed and have enough system resources you can increase
this limit to a higher value, for example: 100000 or 1000000. Before release 7.0,
a value of 0 meant no limit so that all tuples were stored in memory before being
flushed to disk. In the 7.x branch this has been removed and chunks will be set to the
default: 10000
.IP BLOB_LIMIT 4
.IX Item "BLOB_LIMIT"
When Ora2Pg detects a table with BLOB data, it will automatically reduce the
value of this directive by dividing it by 10 until its value is below 1000.
You can control this value by setting BLOB_LIMIT. Exporting BLOBs uses lot of
resources; setting it to a too high value can produce OOM errors.
.IP CLOB_AS_BLOB 4
.IX Item "CLOB_AS_BLOB"
Applies same behavior on CLOBs than BLOBs with BLOB_LIMIT settings. This is
especially useful if you have large CLOB data. Default: enabled
.IP OUTPUT 4
.IX Item "OUTPUT"
The Ora2Pg output filename can be changed with this directive. Default value is
output.sql. If you set the file name with extension .gz or .bz2 the output will
be automatically compressed. This requires that the Compress::Zlib Perl module
is installed if the filename extension is .gz and that the bzip2 system command
is installed for the .bz2 extension.
.IP OUTPUT_DIR 4
.IX Item "OUTPUT_DIR"
Since release 7.0, you can define a base directory where the files will be written.
The directory must exist.
.IP BZIP2 4
.IX Item "BZIP2"
This directive allows you to specify the full path to the bzip2 program if it
can not be found in the PATH environment variable.
.IP FILE_PER_CONSTRAINT 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_CONSTRAINT"
Allows object constraints to be saved in a separate file during schema export.
The file will be named CONSTRAINTS_OUTPUT, where OUTPUT is the value of the
corresponding configuration directive. You can use .gz or .bz2 extension to
enable compression. Default is to save all data in the OUTPUT file. This
directive is usable only with TABLE export type.
.Sp
The constraints can be imported quickly into PostgreSQL using the LOAD export
type to parallelize their creation over multiple (\-j or JOBS) connections.
.IP FILE_PER_INDEX 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_INDEX"
Allows indexes to be saved in a separate file during schema export. The file
will be named INDEXES_OUTPUT, where OUTPUT is the value of the corresponding
configuration directive. You can use .gz or .bz2 file extension to enable
compression. Default is to save all data in the OUTPUT file. This directive
is usable only with TABLE AND TABLESPACE export type. With the TABLESPACE
export, it is used to write "ALTER INDEX ... TABLESPACE ..." into a separate
file named TBSP_INDEXES_OUTPUT that can be loaded at the end of the migration after
the indexes creation to move the indexes.
.Sp
The indexes can be imported quickly into PostgreSQL using the LOAD export
type to parallelize their creation over multiple (\-j or JOBS) connections.
.IP FILE_PER_FKEYS 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_FKEYS"
Allows foreign key declarations to be saved in a separate file during
schema export. By default foreign keys are exported into the main
output file or in the CONSTRAINT_output.sql file. When enabled, foreign
keys will be exported into a file named FKEYS_output.sql
.IP FILE_PER_TABLE 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_TABLE"
Allows data export to be saved in one file per table/view. The files will be
named as tablename_OUTPUT, where OUTPUT is the value of the corresponding
configuration directive. You can still use .gz or .bz2 extension in the OUTPUT
directive to enable compression. Default 0 will save all data in one file, set
it to 1 to enable this feature. This is usable only during INSERT or COPY export
type.
.IP FILE_PER_FUNCTION 4
.IX Item "FILE_PER_FUNCTION"
Allows functions, procedures and triggers to be saved in one file per object.
The files will be named as objectname_OUTPUT, where OUTPUT is the value of the
corresponding configuration directive. You can still use .gz or .bz2 extension
in the OUTPUT directive to enable compression. Default 0 will save all in one
single file, set it to 1 to enable this feature. This is usable only during the
corresponding export type; the package body export has a special behavior.
.Sp
When export type is PACKAGE and you've enabled this directive, Ora2Pg will
create a directory per package, named with the lower case name of the package,
and will create one file per function/procedure in that directory. If the
configuration directive is not enabled, it will create one file per package as
packagename_OUTPUT, where OUTPUT is the value of the corresponding directive.
.IP TRUNCATE_TABLE 4
.IX Item "TRUNCATE_TABLE"
If this directive is set to 1, a TRUNCATE TABLE instruction will be added before
loading data. This is usable only during INSERT or COPY export types.
.Sp
When activated, the instruction will be added only if there's no global DELETE
clause or no specific one for to the current table (see below).
.IP DELETE 4
.IX Item "DELETE"
Supports including a DELETE FROM ... WHERE clause filter before importing
data to perform a delete of some lines instead of truncating tables.
Value is constructed as follows: TABLE_NAME[DELETE_WHERE_CLAUSE], or
if you have only one where clause for all tables just put the delete
clause as a single value. Both are possible too. Here are some examples:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        DELETE  1=1    # Apply to all tables and delete all tuples
\&        DELETE  TABLE_TEST[ID1=\*(Aq001\*(Aq]   # Apply only on table TABLE_TEST
\&        DELETE  TABLE_TEST[ID1=\*(Aq001\*(Aq OR ID1=\*(Aq002] DATE_CREATE > \*(Aq2001\-01\-01\*(Aq TABLE_INFO[NAME=\*(Aqtest\*(Aq]
.Ve
.Sp
The last example applies two different delete where clauses on tables TABLE_TEST and
TABLE_INFO and a generic delete where clause on DATE_CREATE to all other tables.
If TRUNCATE_TABLE is enabled it will be applied to all tables not covered by
the DELETE definition.
.Sp
These DELETE clauses might be useful with regular "updates".
.IP STOP_ON_ERROR 4
.IX Item "STOP_ON_ERROR"
Set this parameter to 0 to not include the call to \eset ON_ERROR_STOP ON in
all SQL scripts generated by Ora2Pg. By default this order is always present
so that the script will immediately abort when an error is encountered.
.IP COPY_FREEZE 4
.IX Item "COPY_FREEZE"
Enable this directive to use COPY FREEZE instead of a simple COPY to
export data with rows already frozen. This is intended as a performance
option for initial data loading. Rows will be frozen only if the table
being loaded has been created or truncated in the current sub-transaction.
This will only work with export to file and when \-J or ORACLE_COPIES is
not set or defaults to 1. It can be used with direct import into PostgreSQL
under the same condition but \-j or JOBS must also be unset or default to 1.
.IP CREATE_OR_REPLACE 4
.IX Item "CREATE_OR_REPLACE"
By default Ora2Pg uses CREATE OR REPLACE in functions and views DDL. If you
 need not to override existing functions or views, disable this configuration
directive \- DDL will not include OR REPLACE.
.IP DROP_IF_EXISTS 4
.IX Item "DROP_IF_EXISTS"
To add a DROP <OBJECT> IF EXISTS before creating the object, enable
this directive. Can be useful in iterative work. Default is disabled.
.IP EXPORT_GTT 4
.IX Item "EXPORT_GTT"
PostgreSQL does not support Global Temporary Tables natively but you can use
the pgtt extension to emulate this behavior. Enable this directive to export
global temporary tables.
.IP PGTT_NOSUPERUSER 4
.IX Item "PGTT_NOSUPERUSER"
By default the pgtt extension is loaded using superuser privileges. Enable it
if you run the SQL scripts generated using a non superuser user. It will use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    LOAD \*(Aq$libdir/plugins/pgtt\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
instead of default:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    LOAD \*(Aqpgtt\*(Aq;
.Ve
.IP NO_HEADER 4
.IX Item "NO_HEADER"
Enabling this directive will prevent Ora2Pg from printing its header into
output files. Only the translated code will be written.
.IP PSQL_RELATIVE_PATH 4
.IX Item "PSQL_RELATIVE_PATH"
By default, Ora2Pg uses \ei psql command to execute generated SQL files.
If you want to use a relative path following the script execution file,
enabling this option will use \eir. See psql help for more information.
.IP DATA_VALIDATION_ROWS 4
.IX Item "DATA_VALIDATION_ROWS"
Number of rows that must be retrieved on both sides for data validation.
Default is to compare the first 10000 rows. A value of 0 means compare
all rows.
.IP DATA_VALIDATION_ORDERING 4
.IX Item "DATA_VALIDATION_ORDERING"
Order of rows between both sides is different once the data has been
modified. In this case data must be ordered using a primary key or a
unique index, meaning that a table without such object cannot be
compared. If the validation is done just after the data migration without
any data modification, the validation can be done on all tables without any
ordering.
.IP DATA_VALIDATION_ERROR 4
.IX Item "DATA_VALIDATION_ERROR"
Stop validating data from a table after a certain amount of row mismatches.
Default is to stop after 10 rows validation errors.
.IP TRANSFORM_VALUE 4
.IX Item "TRANSFORM_VALUE"
Use this directive to specify which transformation should be applied to a
column when exporting data. Value must be a semicolon-separated list of
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   TABLE[COLUMN_NAME, <replace code in SELECT target list>]
.Ve
.Sp
For example, to replace the string 'Oracle' with 'PostgreSQL' in a varchar2 column, use the following.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   TRANSFORM_VALUE   ERROR_LOG_SAMPLE[DBMS_TYPE:regexp_replace("DBMS_TYPE",\*(AqOracle\*(Aq,\*(AqPostgreSQL\*(Aq)]
.Ve
.Sp
or to replace all Oracle \fBchar\fR\|(0) in a string with a space character:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    TRANSFORM_VALUE   CLOB_TABLE[CHARDATA:translate("CHARDATA", chr(0), \*(Aq \*(Aq)]
.Ve
.Sp
The expression will be applied in the SQL statement used to extract data
from the source database.
.IP NO_START_SCN 4
.IX Item "NO_START_SCN"
Enable this directive if you don't want to export all data based on current
SCN. By default Ora2Pg get first the current SCN and then retrieve all table
data using this SCN to be consistant in case of data modification.
.PP
When using Ora2Pg export type INSERT or COPY to dump data to a file and
FILE_PER_TABLE is enabled, you will be warned that Ora2Pg will not export
data again if the file already exists. This is to prevent downloading
table data twice when dealing with huge amount of data. To force the download of data from these tables
you have to remove the existing output file first.
.PP
If you want to import data on the fly to the PostgreSQL database, you have three
configuration directives to set the PostgreSQL database connection. This is only
possible with COPY or INSERT export type as for database schema there's no real
benefit to do that.
.IP PG_DSN 4
.IX Item "PG_DSN"
Use this directive to set the PostgreSQL data source namespace using DBD::Pg
Perl module as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:Pg:dbname=pgdb;host=localhost;port=5432
.Ve
.Sp
will connect to database 'pgdb' on localhost at tcp port 5432.
.Sp
Note that this directive is only used for data export, other exports need to
be imported manually through the use of psql or any other PostgreSQL client.
.Sp
To use SSL encrypted connection you must add sslmode=require to the connection
string as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        dbi:Pg:dbname=pgdb;host=localhost;port=5432;sslmode=require
.Ve
.IP "PG_USER and PG_PWD" 4
.IX Item "PG_USER and PG_PWD"
These two directives are used to set the login user and password.
.Sp
If you do not supply credentials with PG_PWD and you have installed the
Term::ReadKey Perl module, Ora2Pg will ask for the password interactively. If
PG_USER is not set it will be asked interactively too.
.IP SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT 4
.IX Item "SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT"
Specifies whether transaction commit will wait for WAL records to be written
to disk before the command returns a "success" indication to the client. This
is equivalent to setting the synchronous_commit directive in the postgresql.conf file.
This is only used when you load data directly to PostgreSQL; the default is
off to disable synchronous commit to gain speed at writing data. Some modified
versions of PostgreSQL, like Greenplum, do not have this setting, so in this
case set this directive to 1, and ora2pg will not try to change the setting.
.IP PG_INITIAL_COMMAND 4
.IX Item "PG_INITIAL_COMMAND"
This directive can be used to send an initial command to PostgreSQL, just after
the connection. For example to set some session parameters. This directive can
be used multiple times.
.IP INSERT_ON_CONFLICT 4
.IX Item "INSERT_ON_CONFLICT"
When enabled this instructs Ora2Pg to add an ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING clause to all
INSERT statements generated for this type of data export.
.SS "Column type control"
.IX Subsection "Column type control"
.IP PG_NUMERIC_TYPE 4
.IX Item "PG_NUMERIC_TYPE"
If set to 1, replace portable numeric type with PostgreSQL internal type.
Oracle data type NUMBER(p,s) is approximately converted to real and
float PostgreSQL data types. If you have monetary fields or don't want
rounding issues with the extra decimals, you should preserve the same
numeric(p,s) PostgreSQL data type. Do this only if you need exactness
because using numeric(p,s) is slower than using real or double.
.IP PG_INTEGER_TYPE 4
.IX Item "PG_INTEGER_TYPE"
If set to 1, replace portable numeric type with PostgreSQL internal type.
Oracle data types NUMBER(p) or NUMBER are converted to smallint, integer
or bigint PostgreSQL data types following the value of the precision. If
NUMBER without precision is set to DEFAULT_NUMERIC (see below).
.IP DEFAULT_NUMERIC 4
.IX Item "DEFAULT_NUMERIC"
NUMBER without precision is converted by default to bigint only if
PG_INTEGER_TYPE is true. You can override this value to any PG type,
like integer or float.
.IP DATA_TYPE 4
.IX Item "DATA_TYPE"
If you're experiencing any problems in data type schema conversion, with this
directive you can take full control of the correspondence between Oracle and
PostgreSQL types to redefine data type translation used in Ora2pg. The syntax
is a comma-separated list of "Oracle datatype:PostgreSQL datatype". Here is
the default list used:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        DATA_TYPE       VARCHAR2:varchar,NVARCHAR2:varchar,NVARCHAR:varchar,NCHAR:char,DATE:timestamp(0),LONG:text,LONG RAW:bytea,CLOB:text,NCLOB:text,BLOB:bytea,BFILE:bytea,RAW(16):uuid,RAW(32):uuid,RAW:bytea,UROWID:oid,ROWID:oid,FLOAT:double precision,DEC:decimal,DECIMAL:decimal,DOUBLE PRECISION:double precision,INT:integer,INTEGER:integer,REAL:real,SMALLINT:smallint,BINARY_FLOAT:double precision,BINARY_DOUBLE:double precision,TIMESTAMP:timestamp,XMLTYPE:xml,BINARY_INTEGER:integer,PLS_INTEGER:integer,TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE:timestamp with time zone,TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE:timestamp with time zone
.Ve
.Sp
The directive and the list definition must be a single line.
.Sp
Note that when RAW(16) or RAW(32) columns are found or when the RAW column
has "\fBSYS_GUID()\fR" as default value, Ora2Pg will automatically translate the
type of the column into uuid which might be the right translation in most cases.
In this case data will be automatically migrated as PostgreSQL uuid
data type provided by the "uuid-ossp" extension.
.Sp
If you want to replace a type with a precision and scale you need to escape
the comma with a backslash. For example, if you want to replace all NUMBER(*,0)
with bigint instead of numeric(38) add the following:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&       DATA_TYPE       NUMBER(*\e,0):bigint
.Ve
.Sp
You don't have to repeat all default type conversions. Instead just specify
the ones you want to rewrite.
.Sp
There's a special case with BFILE when they are converted to type TEXT \- they
will just contain the full path to the external file. If you set the
destination type to BYTEA (the default), Ora2Pg will export the content of the
BFILE as bytea. The third case is when you set the destination type to EFILE \-
in this case, Ora2Pg will export it as an EFILE record: (DIRECTORY, FILENAME).
Use the DIRECTORY export type to export the existing directories as well as
privileges on those directories.
.Sp
There's no SQL function available to retrieve the path to the BFILE. Ora2Pg
has to create one using the DBMS_LOB package.
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ora2pg_get_bfilename( p_bfile IN BFILE )
\&        RETURN VARCHAR2
\&        AS
\&            l_dir   VARCHAR2(4000);
\&            l_fname VARCHAR2(4000);
\&            l_path  VARCHAR2(4000);
\&        BEGIN
\&            dbms_lob.FILEGETNAME( p_bfile, l_dir, l_fname );
\&            SELECT directory_path INTO l_path FROM all_directories
\&                WHERE directory_name = l_dir;
\&            l_dir := rtrim(l_path,\*(Aq/\*(Aq);
\&            RETURN l_dir || \*(Aq/\*(Aq || l_fname;
\&        END;
.Ve
.Sp
This function is only created if Ora2Pg found a table with a BFILE column and
that the destination type is TEXT. The function is dropped at the end of the
export. This concern both, COPY and INSERT export type.
.Sp
There's no SQL function available to retrieve BFILE as an EFILE record, therefore
Ora2Pg needs to create one using the DBMS_LOB package.
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ora2pg_get_efile( p_bfile IN BFILE )
\&        RETURN VARCHAR2
\&        AS
\&            l_dir   VARCHAR2(4000);
\&            l_fname VARCHAR2(4000);
\&        BEGIN
\&            dbms_lob.FILEGETNAME( p_bfile, l_dir, l_fname );
\&            RETURN \*(Aq(\*(Aq || l_dir || \*(Aq,\*(Aq || l_fnamei || \*(Aq)\*(Aq;
\&        END;
.Ve
.Sp
This function is only created if Ora2Pg finds a table with a BFILE column and
that the destination type is EFILE. The function is dropped at the end of the
export. This concerns both COPY and INSERT export types.
.Sp
To set the destination type, use the DATA_TYPE configuration directive:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        DATA_TYPE       BFILE:EFILE
.Ve
.Sp
for example.
.Sp
The EFILE type is a user defined type created by the PostgreSQL extension
external_file that can be found here: https://github.com/darold/external_file
This is a port of the BFILE Oracle type to PostgreSQL.
.Sp
There's no SQL function available to retrieve the content of a BFILE. Ora2Pg
needs to create one using the DBMS_LOB package.
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ora2pg_get_bfile( p_bfile IN BFILE ) RETURN
\&        BLOB
\&          AS
\&                filecontent BLOB := NULL;
\&                src_file BFILE := NULL;
\&                l_step PLS_INTEGER := 12000;
\&                l_dir   VARCHAR2(4000);
\&                l_fname VARCHAR2(4000);

\&          BEGIN
\&            IF p_bfile IS NULL THEN

\&            END IF;
\&
\&            DBMS_LOB.FILEGETNAME( p_bfile, l_dir, l_fname );
\&            src_file := BFILENAME( l_dir, l_fname );

\&            DBMS_LOB.LOADBLOBFROMFILE (filecontent, src_file, DBMS_LOB.LOBMAXSIZE, offset, offset);
\&            DBMS_LOB.FILECLOSE(src_file);
\&            RETURN filecontent;
\&        END;
.Ve
.Sp
This function is only created if Ora2Pg finds a table with a BFILE column and
that the destination type is bytea (the default). The function is dropped at
the end of the export. This applies to both COPY and INSERT export types.
.Sp
Regarding ROWID and UROWID, they are converted into OID by "logical" default,
but this will throw an error during data import. There is no equivalent data type
so you might want to use the DATA_TYPE directive to change the corresponding
type in PostgreSQL. You should consider replacing this data type with a bigserial
(autoincremented sequence), text, or uuid data type.
.IP MODIFY_TYPE 4
.IX Item "MODIFY_TYPE"
Sometimes you need to force the destination type. For example, a column
exported as timestamp by Ora2Pg can be forced into type date. Value is
a comma-separated list of TABLE:COLUMN:TYPE structures. If you need to use
commas or spaces inside type definitions, you will have to escape them with backslashes.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        MODIFY_TYPE     TABLE1:COL3:varchar,TABLE1:COL4:decimal(9\e,6)
.Ve
.Sp
The type of table1.col3 will be replaced by varchar and table1.col4 by
decimal with precision and scale.
.Sp
If the column's type is a user-defined type, Ora2Pg will autodetect the
composite type and will export its data using \fBROW()\fR. Some Oracle user-defined
types are just arrays of a native types. In this case, you may want
to transform this column into a simple array of a PostgreSQL native type.
To do so, just redefine the destination type as wanted, and Ora2Pg will
also transform the data as an array. For example, with the following
definition in Oracle:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE mem_type IS VARRAY(10) of VARCHAR2(15);
\&        CREATE TABLE club (Name VARCHAR2(10),
\&                Address VARCHAR2(20),
\&                City VARCHAR2(20),
\&                Phone VARCHAR2(8),
\&                Members mem_type
\&        );
.Ve
.Sp
custom type "mem_type" is just a string array and can be translated into
the following in PostgreSQL:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        CREATE TABLE club (
\&                name varchar(10),
\&                address varchar(20),
\&                city varchar(20),
\&                phone varchar(8),
\&                members text[]
\&        ) ;
.Ve
.Sp
To do so, just use the directive as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        MODIFY_TYPE     CLUB:MEMBERS:text[]
.Ve
.Sp
Ora2Pg will take care to transform all data of this column into the correct
format. Only arrays of characters and numeric types are supported.
.IP TO_NUMBER_CONVERSION 4
.IX Item "TO_NUMBER_CONVERSION"
By default, Oracle's call to function TO_NUMBER will be translated as a cast
into numeric. For example, TO_NUMBER('10.1234') is converted into PostgreSQL
call to_number('10.1234')::numeric. If you want, you can cast the call to integer
or bigint by changing the value of the configuration directive. If you need
better control of the format, just set it as value, for example:
   TO_NUMBER_CONVERSION    99999999999999999999.9999999999
will convert the code above as:
   TO_NUMBER('10.1234', '99999999999999999999.9999999999')
Any value of the directive that is not numeric, integer or bigint will
be taken as a mask format. If set to none, no conversion will be done.
.IP VARCHAR_TO_TEXT 4
.IX Item "VARCHAR_TO_TEXT"
By default varchar2 without size constraint are translated into text. If you
want to keep the varchar name, disable this directive.
.IP FORCE_IDENTITY_BIGINT 4
.IX Item "FORCE_IDENTITY_BIGINT"
Usually identity columns must be bigint to correspond to an auto increment
sequence so Ora2Pg always forces it to be a bigint. If, for any reason you
want Ora2Pg to respect the DATA_TYPE you have set for identity columns then
disable this directive.
.IP TO_CHAR_NOTIMEZONE 4
.IX Item "TO_CHAR_NOTIMEZONE"
If you want Ora2Pg to remove any timezone information from the format part
of the \fBTO_CHAR()\fR function, enable this directive. Disabled by default.
.SS "Taking export under control"
.IX Subsection "Taking export under control"
The following other configuration directives interact directly with the export process and give you fine granularity in database export control.
.IP SKIP 4
.IX Item "SKIP"
For TABLE export you may not want to export all schema constraints, the SKIP
configuration directive allows you to specify a space-separated list of
constraints that should not be exported. Possible values are:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        \- fkeys: turn off foreign key constraints
\&        \- pkeys: turn off primary keys
\&        \- ukeys: turn off unique column constraints
\&        \- indexes: turn off all other index types
\&        \- checks: turn off check constraints
.Ve
.Sp
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        SKIP    indexes,checks
.Ve
.Sp
will remove indexes and check constraints from export.
.IP PKEY_IN_CREATE 4
.IX Item "PKEY_IN_CREATE"
Enable this directive if you want to add primary key definition inside the
create table statement. If disabled (the default) primary key definition
will be added with an alter table statement. Enable it if you are exporting
to GreenPlum PostgreSQL database.
.IP KEEP_PKEY_NAMES 4
.IX Item "KEEP_PKEY_NAMES"
By default names of the primary and unique keys in the source Oracle database
are ignored and key names are autogenerated in the target PostgreSQL database
with the PostgreSQL internal default naming rules. If you want to preserve
Oracle primary and unique key names set this option to 1.
.IP FKEY_ADD_UPDATE 4
.IX Item "FKEY_ADD_UPDATE"
This directive allows you to add an ON UPDATE CASCADE option to a foreign
key when an ON DELETE CASCADE is defined or always. Oracle does not support
this feature, you have to use triggers to operate the ON UPDATE CASCADE.
As PostgreSQL has this feature, you can choose how to add the foreign
key option. There are three values to this directive: never, the default
that means that foreign keys will be declared exactly like in Oracle.
The second value is delete, that mean that the ON UPDATE CASCADE option
will be added only if the ON DELETE CASCADE is already defined on the
foreign Keys. The last value, always, will force all foreign keys to be
defined using the update option.
.IP FKEY_DEFERRABLE 4
.IX Item "FKEY_DEFERRABLE"
When exporting tables, Ora2Pg normally exports constraints as they are, if they
are non-deferrable they are exported as non-deferrable. However, non-deferrable
constraints will probably cause problems when attempting to import data to Pg.
The FKEY_DEFERRABLE option set to 1 will cause all foreign key constraints to
be exported as deferrable.
.IP DEFER_FKEY 4
.IX Item "DEFER_FKEY"
In addition to exporting data when the DEFER_FKEY option is set to 1, it will add
a command to defer all foreign key constraints during data export and
the import will be done in a single transaction. This will work only if
foreign keys have been exported as deferrable and you are not using direct
import to PostgreSQL (PG_DSN is not defined). Constraints will then be
checked at the end of the transaction.
.Sp
This directive can also be enabled if you want to force all foreign keys
to be created as deferrable and initially deferred during schema export
(TABLE export type).
.IP DROP_FKEY 4
.IX Item "DROP_FKEY"
If deferring foreign keys is not possible due to the amount of data in a
single transaction, you've not exported foreign keys as deferrable or you
are using direct import to PostgreSQL, you can use the DROP_FKEY directive.
.Sp
It will drop all foreign keys before all data import and recreate them at
the end of the import.
.IP DROP_INDEXES 4
.IX Item "DROP_INDEXES"
This directive allows you to gain a lot of speed during data import
by removing all indexes that are not an automatic index (indexes of primary
keys) and recreate them at the end of data import. Of course it is far better
to not import indexes and constraints before having imported all data.
.IP DISABLE_TRIGGERS 4
.IX Item "DISABLE_TRIGGERS"
This directive is used to disable triggers on all tables in COPY or INSERT
export modes. Available values are USER (disable user-defined triggers only)
and ALL (includes RI system triggers). Default is 0: do not add SQL statements
to disable triggers before data import.
.Sp
If you want to disable triggers during data migration, set the value to
USER if you are connected as a non-superuser and ALL if you are connected
as a PostgreSQL superuser. A value of 1 is equal to USER.
.IP DISABLE_SEQUENCE 4
.IX Item "DISABLE_SEQUENCE"
If set to 1, it disables alter of sequences on all tables during COPY or INSERT export
mode. This is used to prevent the update of sequences during data migration.
Default is 0, alter sequences.
.IP NOESCAPE 4
.IX Item "NOESCAPE"
By default, all data that are not of type date or time are escaped. If you
experience any problems with that, you can set it to 1 to disable character
escaping during data export. This directive is only used during a COPY export.
See STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS for enabling/disabling escape with INSERT
statements.
.IP STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS 4
.IX Item "STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS"
This controls whether ordinary string literals ('...') treat backslashes
literally, as specified in the SQL standard. This was the default before Ora2Pg
v8.5 so that all strings were escaped first; now this is currently on, causing
Ora2Pg to use the escape string syntax (E'...') if this parameter is not
set to 0. This is the exact behavior of the same option in PostgreSQL.
This directive is only used during data export to build INSERT statements.
See NOESCAPE for enabling/disabling escape in COPY statements.
.IP TRIM_TYPE 4
.IX Item "TRIM_TYPE"
If you want to convert CHAR(n) from Oracle into varchar(n) or text in PostgreSQL
using directive DATA_TYPE, you might want to do some trimming on the data. By
default, Ora2Pg will auto-detect this conversion and remove any whitespace at both
leading and trailing positions. If you just want to remove the leading characters,
set the value to LEADING. If you just want to remove the trailing characters, set
the value to TRAILING. Default value is BOTH.
.IP TRIM_CHAR 4
.IX Item "TRIM_CHAR"
The default trimming character is space; use this directive if you need to
change the character that will be removed. For example, set it to \- if you
have leading \- in the char(n) field. To use space as trimming character, comment
this directive, this is the default value.
.IP PRESERVE_CASE 4
.IX Item "PRESERVE_CASE"
If you want to preserve the case of Oracle object names, set this directive to 1.
By default, Ora2Pg will convert all Oracle object names to lower case. I do not
recommend enabling this unless you will always have to double-quote object
names in all your SQL scripts.
.IP ORA_RESERVED_WORDS 4
.IX Item "ORA_RESERVED_WORDS"
Allow escaping of column names using Oracle reserved words. Value is a list of
comma-separated reserved words. Default: audit,comment,references.
.IP USE_RESERVED_WORDS 4
.IX Item "USE_RESERVED_WORDS"
Enable this directive if you have table or column names that are reserved
words for PostgreSQL. Ora2Pg will double quote the name of the object.
.IP GEN_USER_PWD 4
.IX Item "GEN_USER_PWD"
Set this directive to 1 to replace default passwords with random passwords for all
extracted users during a GRANT export.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_MVIEW 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_MVIEW"
Since PostgreSQL 9.3, materialized views are supported with the SQL syntax
\&'CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW'. To force Ora2Pg to use the native PostgreSQL
support, you must enable this configuration \- enabled by default. If you want
to use the old style with table and a set of functions, you should disable it.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_IFEXISTS 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_IFEXISTS"
PostgreSQL versions below 9.x do not support IF EXISTS in DDL statements.
Disabling the directive with value 0 will prevent Ora2Pg to from adding those
keywords in all generated statements. Default value is 1, enabled.
.IP PG_VERSION 4
.IX Item "PG_VERSION"
Set the PostgreSQL major version number of the target database. Ex: 9.6 or 13.
Default is current major version at time of a new release. This replaces the
old and deprecated PG_SUPPORTS_* configuration directives described below.
.IP "PG_SUPPORTS_ROLE (Deprecated)" 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_ROLE (Deprecated)"
This option is deprecated since Ora2Pg release v7.3.
.Sp
By default Oracle roles are translated into PostgreSQL groups. If you have
PostgreSQL 8.1 or higher, consider the use of ROLES and set this directive to 1
to export roles.
.IP "PG_SUPPORTS_INOUT (Deprecated)" 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_INOUT (Deprecated)"
This option is deprecated since Ora2Pg release v7.3.
.Sp
If set to 0, all IN, OUT or INOUT parameters will not be used in the generated
PostgreSQL function declarations (disable it for PostgreSQL database versions
lower than 8.1). This is now enabled by default.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_DEFAULT 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_DEFAULT"
This directive enables or disables the use of default parameter values in function
exports. Prior to PostgreSQL 8.4, such default values were not supported. This feature
is now enabled by default.
.IP "PG_SUPPORTS_WHEN (Deprecated)" 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_WHEN (Deprecated)"
Adds support for WHEN clauses on triggers as PostgreSQL v9.0 now supports them. This
directive is enabled by default; set it to 0 to disable this feature.
.IP "PG_SUPPORTS_INSTEADOF (Deprecated)" 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_INSTEADOF (Deprecated)"
Adds support for INSTEAD OF usage on triggers (used with PG >= 9.1). If this
directive is disabled, the INSTEAD OF triggers will be rewritten as Pg rules.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_CHECKOPTION 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_CHECKOPTION"
When enabled, exports views with CHECK OPTION. Disable it if you have a PostgreSQL
version prior to 9.4. Default: 1, enabled.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_IFEXISTS 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_IFEXISTS"
If disabled, do not export objects with IF EXISTS statements.
Enabled by default.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_PARTITION 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_PARTITION"
PostgreSQL versions prior to 10.0 do not have native partitioning.
Enable this directive if you want to use declarative partitioning.
Enabled by default.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_SUBSTR 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_SUBSTR"
Some versions of PostgreSQL like Redshift don't support \fBsubstr()\fR
and need to be replaced by a call to \fBsubstring()\fR. In this case,
disable it.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_NAMED_OPERATOR 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_NAMED_OPERATOR"
Disable this directive if you are using PG < 9.5. PL/SQL operators used in
named parameters => will be replaced by PostgreSQL's proprietary operator :=
Enabled by default.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_IDENTITY 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_IDENTITY"
Enable this directive if you have PostgreSQL >= 10 to use IDENTITY columns
instead of serial or bigserial data types. If PG_SUPPORTS_IDENTITY is disabled
and there is an IDENTITY column in the Oracle table, they are exported as serial
or bigserial columns. When it is enabled they are exported as IDENTITY columns
like:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&      CREATE TABLE identity_test_tab (
\&              id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
\&              description varchar(30)
\&      ) ;
.Ve
.Sp
If there are non-default sequence options set in Oracle, they will be appended
after the IDENTITY keyword.
Additionally in both cases, Ora2Pg will create a file AUTOINCREMENT_output.sql
with an embedded function to update the associated sequences with the restart
value set to "SELECT max(colname)+1 FROM tablename". Of course this file must
be imported after data import otherwise sequence will be kept at start value.
Enabled by default.
.IP PG_SUPPORTS_PROCEDURE 4
.IX Item "PG_SUPPORTS_PROCEDURE"
PostgreSQL v11 adds support for PROCEDURE, enable it if you use such version.
.IP BITMAP_AS_GIN 4
.IX Item "BITMAP_AS_GIN"
Use btree_gin extension to create bitmap-like index with pg >= 9.4.
You will need to create the extension yourself:
      create extension btree_gin;
Default is to create GIN index, when disabled, a btree index will be created.
.IP PG_BACKGROUND 4
.IX Item "PG_BACKGROUND"
Use pg_background extension to create an autonomous transaction instead
of using a dblink wrapper. With pg >= 9.5 only. Default is to use dblink.
See https://github.com/vibhorkum/pg_background about this extension.
.IP DBLINK_CONN 4
.IX Item "DBLINK_CONN"
By default if you have an autonomous transaction translated using dblink
extension instead of pg_background, the connection is defined using the
values set with PG_DSN, PG_USER and PG_PWD. If you want to fully override
the connection string, use this directive to set the connection
in the autonomous transaction wrapper function. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        DBLINK_CONN    port=5432 dbname=pgdb host=localhost user=pguser password=pgpass
.Ve
.IP LONGREADLEN 4
.IX Item "LONGREADLEN"
Use this directive to set the database handle's 'LongReadLen' attribute to a
value that will be larger than the expected size of the LOBs. The default
is 1MB which may not be enough to extract BLOBs or CLOBs. If the size of the
LOB exceeds the 'LongReadLen' DBD::Oracle will return an 'ORA\-24345: A Truncation'
error. Default: 1023*1024 bytes.
.Sp
Take a look at this page to learn more: http://search.cpan.org/~pythian/DBD\-Oracle\-1.22/Oracle.pm#Data_Interface_for_Persistent_LOBs
.Sp
Important note: If you increase the value of this directive take care that
DATA_LIMIT will probably need to be reduced. Even if you only have a 1MB blob,
trying to read 10000 of them (the default DATA_LIMIT) all at once will require
10GB of memory. You may extract data from those tables separately and set a
DATA_LIMIT to 500 or lower, otherwise you may experience some out of memory issues.
.IP LONGTRUNKOK 4
.IX Item "LONGTRUNKOK"
If you want to bypass the 'ORA\-24345: A Truncation' error, set this directive
to 1. It will truncate the data extracted to the LongReadLen value. Disabled
by default so that you will be warned if your LongReadLen value is not high
enough.
.IP USE_LOB_LOCATOR 4
.IX Item "USE_LOB_LOCATOR"
Disable this if you want to load the full content of BLOB and CLOB and not use
LOB locators. In this case, you will have to set LONGREADLEN to the right
value. Note that this will not improve the speed of BLOB export as most of the
time is always consumed by the bytea escaping and in this case, export is
done line by line and not by chunk of DATA_LIMIT rows. For more information
on how it works, see http://search.cpan.org/~pythian/DBD\-Oracle\-1.74/lib/DBD/Oracle.pm#Data_Interface_for_LOB_Locators
.Sp
Default is enabled; it uses LOB locators.
.IP LOB_CHUNK_SIZE 4
.IX Item "LOB_CHUNK_SIZE"
Oracle recommends reading from and writing to a LOB in batches using a
multiple of the LOB chunk size. This chunk size defaults to 8k (8192).
Recent tests have shown that the best performance can be reached with higher
values like 512K or 4Mb.

A quick benchmark with 30120 rows with different size of BLOB (200x5Mb,
19800x212k, 10000x942K, 100x17Mb, 20x156Mb), with DATA_LIMIT=100,
LONGREADLEN=170Mb and a total table size of 20GB gives:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&       no lob locator  : 22m46,218s (1365 sec., avg: 22 recs/sec)
\&       chunk size 8k   : 15m50,886s (951 sec., avg: 31 recs/sec)
\&       chunk size 512k : 1m28,161s (88 sec., avg: 342 recs/sec)
\&       chunk size 4Mb  : 1m23,717s (83 sec., avg: 362 recs/sec)
.Ve
.Sp
In conclusion, it can be more than 10 times faster with LOB_CHUNK_SIZE set
to 4Mb. Depending on the size of most BLOBs, you may want to adjust the value
here. For example, if you have a majority of small lobs below 8K, using 8192
is better to not waste space. Default value for LOB_CHUNK_SIZE is 512000.
.IP XML_PRETTY 4
.IX Item "XML_PRETTY"
Forces the use of \fBgetStringVal()\fR instead of \fBgetClobVal()\fR for XML data export. Default is 1,
enabled for backward compatibility. Set it to 0 to use extract method like CLOB.
Note that XML values extracted with \fBgetStringVal()\fR must not exceed VARCHAR2 size
limit (4000); otherwise, it will return an error.
.IP ENABLE_MICROSECOND 4
.IX Item "ENABLE_MICROSECOND"
Set it to 0 if you want to disable export of milliseconds from Oracle timestamp
columns. By default, milliseconds are exported by using the following format:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \*(AqYYYY\-MM\-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
Disabling will force the use of the following Oracle format:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        to_char(..., \*(AqYYYY\-MM\-DD HH24:MI:SS\*(Aq)
.Ve
.Sp
By default, milliseconds are exported.
.IP DISABLE_COMMENT 4
.IX Item "DISABLE_COMMENT"
Set this to 1 if you don't want to export comments associated with tables and
columns definition. Default is enabled.
.SS "Control MySQL export behavior"
.IX Subsection "Control MySQL export behavior"
.IP MYSQL_PIPES_AS_CONCAT 4
.IX Item "MYSQL_PIPES_AS_CONCAT"
Enable this if double pipe and double ampersand (|| and &&) should not be
taken as equivalent to OR and AND. It depends on the variable \f(CW@sql_mode\fR.
Use it only if Ora2Pg fails on auto-detecting this behavior.
.IP MYSQL_INTERNAL_EXTRACT_FORMAT 4
.IX Item "MYSQL_INTERNAL_EXTRACT_FORMAT"
Enable this directive if you want \fBEXTRACT()\fR replacement to use the internal
format returned as an integer, for example DD HH24:MM:SS will be replaced
with format; DDHH24MMSS::bigint, this depends on your apps usage.
.SS "Control SQL Server export behavior"
.IX Subsection "Control SQL Server export behavior"
.IP DROP_ROWVERSION 4
.IX Item "DROP_ROWVERSION"
PostgreSQL has no equivalent to rowversion datatype and feature. If you want
to remove these useless columns, enable this directive. Columns of datatype
\&'rowversion' or 'timestamp' will not be exported.
.IP CASE_INSENSITIVE_SEARCH 4
.IX Item "CASE_INSENSITIVE_SEARCH"
Emulate the same behavior of MSSQL with case-insensitive search. If the value
is citext, it will use the citext data type instead of char/varchar/text in
tables DDL (Ora2Pg will add a CHECK constraint for columns with a precision).
Instead of citext, you can also set a collation name that will be used in the
column definitions. To disable case-insensitive search set it to: none.
.IP SELECT_TOP 4
.IX Item "SELECT_TOP"
Appends a TOP N clause to the SELECT command used to extract the data from
SQL Server. This is equivalent to a WHERE ROWNUM < 1000 clause for Oracle.
.SS "Special options to handle character encoding"
.IX Subsection "Special options to handle character encoding"
.IP "NLS_LANG and NLS_NCHAR" 4
.IX Item "NLS_LANG and NLS_NCHAR"
By default, Ora2Pg will set NLS_LANG to AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8 and NLS_NCHAR
to AL32UTF8. It is not recommended to change these settings, but in some cases it
could be useful. Using your own settings with these configuration directives will
change the client encoding on the Oracle side by setting the environment variables
\&\f(CW$ENV\fR{NLS_LANG} and \f(CW$ENV\fR{NLS_NCHAR}.
.IP BINMODE 4
.IX Item "BINMODE"
By default, Ora2Pg will force Perl to use UTF8 encoding. This is done through
a call to the Perl pragma:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        use open \*(Aq:utf8\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
You can override this encoding by using the BINMODE directive. For example, you
can set it to :locale to use your locale or iso\-8859\-7. It will respectively use:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        use open \*(Aq:locale\*(Aq;
\&        use open \*(Aq:encoding(iso\-8859\-7)\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
If you have changed the NLS_LANG to non\-UTF8 encoding, you might want to set this
directive. See http://perldoc.perl.org/5.14.2/open.html for more information.
Most of the time, leave this directive commented.
.IP CLIENT_ENCODING 4
.IX Item "CLIENT_ENCODING"
By default, PostgreSQL client encoding is automatically set to UTF8 to avoid
encoding issues. If you have changed the value of NLS_LANG, you might have to
change the encoding of the PostgreSQL client.
.Sp
You can take a look at the PostgreSQL supported character sets here: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/multibyte.html
.IP FORCE_PLSQL_ENCODING 4
.IX Item "FORCE_PLSQL_ENCODING"
Enable this directive to force UTF8 encoding of the PL/SQL code exported.
Could be helpful in some rare conditions.
.SS "PLSQL to PLPGSQL conversion"
.IX Subsection "PLSQL to PLPGSQL conversion"
Automatic code conversion from Oracle PL/SQL to PostgreSQL PL/PGSQL is a work in
progress in Ora2Pg and you will likely have manual work. The Perl code
used for automatic conversion is stored in a specific Perl Module named
Ora2Pg/PLSQL.pm. Feel free to modify/add your own code and send me patches. The
main work is on function, procedure, package and package body headers and
parameter rewrites.
.IP PLSQL_PGSQL 4
.IX Item "PLSQL_PGSQL"
Enable/disable PLSQL to PLPGSQL conversion. Enabled by default.
.IP NULL_EQUAL_EMPTY 4
.IX Item "NULL_EQUAL_EMPTY"
Ora2Pg can replace all conditions with a test on NULL by calling the
\&\fBcoalesce()\fR function to mimic the Oracle behavior where empty strings are
considered equal to NULL.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        (field1 IS NULL) is replaced by (coalesce(field1::text, \*(Aq\*(Aq) = \*(Aq\*(Aq)
\&        (field2 IS NOT NULL) is replaced by (field2 IS NOT NULL AND field2::text <> \*(Aq\*(Aq)
.Ve
.Sp
You might want this replacement to ensure your application will have the
same behavior, but if you have control over your application, a better way is to
transform empty strings into NULL because PostgreSQL differentiates between them.
.IP EMPTY_LOB_NULL 4
.IX Item "EMPTY_LOB_NULL"
Force \fBempty_clob()\fR and \fBempty_blob()\fR to be exported as NULL instead of an empty
string for the first one and '\ex' for the second. If NULL is allowed in your
column, this might improve data export speed if you have lots of empty lobs.
Default is to preserve the exact data from Oracle.
.IP PACKAGE_AS_SCHEMA 4
.IX Item "PACKAGE_AS_SCHEMA"
If you don't want to export packages as schemas but as simple functions, you
might also want to replace all calls to package_name.function_name. If you
disable the PACKAGE_AS_SCHEMA directive then Ora2Pg will replace all calls
to package_name.\fBfunction_name()\fR with \fBpackage_name_function_name()\fR. Default
is to use a schema to emulate packages.
.Sp
The replacement will be done in all kinds of DDL or code that is parsed by
the PLSQL to PLPGSQL converter. PLSQL_PGSQL must be enabled or \-p used in
command line.
.IP REWRITE_OUTER_JOIN 4
.IX Item "REWRITE_OUTER_JOIN"
Enable this directive if the rewrite of Oracle native syntax (+) of
OUTER JOIN is broken. This will force Ora2Pg to not rewrite such code.
Default is to try to rewrite simple forms of right outer joins for now.
.IP UUID_FUNCTION 4
.IX Item "UUID_FUNCTION"
By default, Ora2Pg will convert calls to \fBSYS_GUID()\fR Oracle function
with a call to uuid_generate_v4 from the uuid-ossp extension. You can
redefine it to use the gen_random_uuid function from the pgcrypto
extension by changing the function name. Default is uuid_generate_v4.
.Sp
Note that when RAW(16) or RAW(32) columns are found or when the RAW column
has "\fBSYS_GUID()\fR" as default value, Ora2Pg will automatically translate the
type of the column into uuid which might be the right translation in most cases.
In this case data will be automatically migrated as PostgreSQL uuid
data type provided by the "uuid-ossp" extension.
.IP FUNCTION_STABLE 4
.IX Item "FUNCTION_STABLE"
By default, Oracle functions are marked as STABLE as they can not modify data
unless when used in PL/SQL with variable assignment or as conditional
expressions. You can force Ora2Pg to create these functions as VOLATILE by
disabling this configuration directive.
.IP COMMENT_COMMIT_ROLLBACK 4
.IX Item "COMMENT_COMMIT_ROLLBACK"
By default, calls to COMMIT/ROLLBACK are kept untouched by Ora2Pg to force
the user to review the logic of the function. Once it is fixed in Oracle
source code or you want to comment these calls, enable the following directive.
.IP COMMENT_SAVEPOINT 4
.IX Item "COMMENT_SAVEPOINT"
It is common to see SAVEPOINT calls inside PL/SQL procedures together with
a ROLLBACK TO savepoint_name. When COMMENT_COMMIT_ROLLBACK is enabled, you
may want to also comment SAVEPOINT calls; in this case enable it.
.IP STRING_CONSTANT_REGEXP 4
.IX Item "STRING_CONSTANT_REGEXP"
Ora2Pg replaces all string constants during the PL/SQL to PL/PGSQL translation.
String constants are all text included between single quotes. If you have some
string placeholders used in dynamic calls to queries, you can set a list of
regexps to be temporarily replaced to not break the parser. For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        STRING_CONSTANT_REGEXP         <placeholder value=".*">
.Ve
.Sp
The list of regexps must use the semi colon as separator.
.IP ALTERNATIVE_QUOTING_REGEXP 4
.IX Item "ALTERNATIVE_QUOTING_REGEXP"
To support the Alternative Quoting Mechanism ('Q' or 'q') for String Literals,
set the regexp with the text capture to use to extract the text part. For
example, with a variable declared as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        c_sample VARCHAR2(100 CHAR) := q\*(Aq{This doesn\*(Aqt work.}\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
the regexp to use must be:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        ALTERNATIVE_QUOTING_REGEXP     q\*(Aq{(.*)}\*(Aq
.Ve
.Sp
Ora2pg will use the $$ delimiter; for the example the result will be:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        c_sample varchar(100) := $$This doesn\*(Aqt work.$$;
.Ve
.Sp
The value of this configuration directive can be a list of regexps
separated by a semicolon. The capture part (between parentheses) is
mandatory in each regexp if you want to restore the string constant.
.IP USE_ORAFCE 4
.IX Item "USE_ORAFCE"
If you want to use functions defined in the Orafce library and prevent
Ora2Pg from translating calls to these functions, enable this directive.
The Orafce library can be found here: https://github.com/orafce/orafce
.Sp
By default, Ora2pg rewrites \fBadd_month()\fR, \fBadd_year()\fR, \fBdate_trunc()\fR and
\&\fBto_char()\fR functions, but you may prefer to use the orafce version of
these functions that do not need any code transformation.
.IP AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION 4
.IX Item "AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION"
Enable translation of autonomous transactions into wrapper functions
using dblink or pg_background extension. If you don't want to use this
translation and just want the function to be exported as a normal one
without the pragma call, disable this directive.
.SS "Materialized View"
.IX Subsection "Materialized View"
Materialized views are exported as snapshot "Snapshot Materialized Views" as
PostgreSQL only supports full refresh.
.PP
If you want to import materialized views in PostgreSQL prior to 9.3, you
have to set configuration directive PG_SUPPORTS_MVIEW to 0. In this case
Ora2Pg will export all materialized views as explained in this document:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        http://tech.jonathangardner.net/wiki/PostgreSQL/Materialized_Views.
.Ve
.PP
When exporting materialized views, Ora2Pg will first add the SQL code to create the "materialized_views" table:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        CREATE TABLE materialized_views (
\&                mview_name text NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
\&                view_name text NOT NULL,
\&                iname text,
\&                last_refresh TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
\&        );
.Ve
.PP
All materialized views will have an entry in this table. It then adds the
plpgsql code to create three functions:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        create_materialized_view(text, text, text) used to create a materialized view
\&        drop_materialized_view(text) used to delete a materialized view
\&        refresh_full_materialized_view(text) used to refresh a view
.Ve
.PP
Then it adds the SQL code to create the view and the materialized view:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        CREATE VIEW mviewname_mview AS
\&        SELECT ... FROM ...;
\&
\&        SELECT create_materialized_view(\*(Aqmviewname\*(Aq,\*(Aqmviewname_mview\*(Aq, change with the name of the column to be used for the index);
.Ve
.PP
The first argument is the name of the materialized view, the second is the name of
the view on which the materialized view is based, and the third is the column
name on which the index should be built (typically the primary key).
This column is not automatically deduced so you need to replace its name.
.PP
As mentioned above, Ora2Pg only supports snapshot materialized views so the table will
be entirely refreshed by first truncating the table and then loading
all data again from the view:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&         refresh_full_materialized_view(\*(Aqmviewname\*(Aq);
.Ve
.PP
To drop the materialized view, you just have to call the \fBdrop_materialized_view()\fR
function with the name of the materialized view as a parameter.
.SS "Other configuration directives"
.IX Subsection "Other configuration directives"
.IP DEBUG 4
.IX Item "DEBUG"
Set it to 1 to enable verbose output.
.IP IMPORT 4
.IX Item "IMPORT"
You can define common Ora2Pg configuration directives in a single file that
can be imported into other configuration files with the IMPORT configuration
directive as follows:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        IMPORT  commonfile.conf
.Ve
.Sp
This will import all configuration directives defined in commonfile.conf into the
current configuration file.
.SS "Exporting views as PostgreSQL tables"
.IX Subsection "Exporting views as PostgreSQL tables"
You can export any Oracle view as a PostgreSQL table simply by setting the TYPE
configuration option to TABLE to get the corresponding create table statement.
Or use type COPY or INSERT to export the corresponding data. To allow this, you
have to specify your views in the VIEW_AS_TABLE configuration option.
.PP
Then if Ora2Pg finds the view, it will extract its schema (if TYPE=TABLE) into
a PG create table form, then it will extract the data (if TYPE=COPY or INSERT)
following the view schema.
.PP
For example, with the following view:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW product_prices (category_id, product_count, low_price, high_price) AS
\&        SELECT  category_id, COUNT(*) as product_count,
\&            MIN(list_price) as low_price,
\&            MAX(list_price) as high_price
\&         FROM   product_information
\&        GROUP BY category_id;
.Ve
.PP
Setting VIEW_AS_TABLE to product_prices and using export type TABLE, will
force Ora2Pg to detect columns' returned types and to generate a create table
statement:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        CREATE TABLE product_prices (
\&                category_id bigint,
\&                product_count integer,
\&                low_price numeric,
\&                high_price numeric
\&        );
.Ve
.PP
Data will be loaded following the COPY or INSERT export type and the view
declaration.
.PP
You can use the ALLOW and EXCLUDE directives in addition to filter other
objects to export.
.SS "Export as Kettle transformation XML files"
.IX Subsection "Export as Kettle transformation XML files"
The KETTLE export type is useful if you want to use Pentaho Data Integrator
(Kettle) to import data to PostgreSQL. With this type of export, Ora2Pg will
generate one XML Kettle transformation file (.ktr) per table and add a line
to manually execute the transformation in the output.sql file. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-c ora2pg.conf \-t KETTLE \-j 12 \-a MYTABLE \-o load_mydata.sh
.Ve
.PP
will generate one file called 'HR.MYTABLE.ktr' and add a line to the output
file (load_mydata.sh):
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        #!/bin/sh
\&
\&        KETTLE_TEMPLATE_PATH=\*(Aq.\*(Aq
\&
\&        JAVAMAXMEM=4096 ./pan.sh \-file $KETTLE_TEMPLATE_PATH/HR.MYTABLE.ktr \-level Detailed
.Ve
.PP
The \-j 12 option will create a template with 12 processes to insert data into
PostgreSQL. It is also possible to specify the number of parallel queries used
to extract data from Oracle with the \-J command line option as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-c ora2pg.conf \-t KETTLE \-J 4 \-j 12 \-a EMPLOYEES \-o load_mydata.sh
.Ve
.PP
This is only possible if there is a unique key defined on a numeric column or
if you have defined the technical key to be used to split the query between cores
in the DEFINED_PKEY configuration directive. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        DEFINED_PK      EMPLOYEES:employee_id
.Ve
.PP
This will force the number of Oracle connection copies to 4 and define the SQL query
as follows in the Kettle XML transformation file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <sql>SELECT * FROM HR.EMPLOYEES WHERE ABS(MOD(employee_id,${Internal.Step.Unique.Count}))=${Internal.Step.Unique.Number}</sql>
.Ve
.PP
The KETTLE export type requires that the Oracle and PostgreSQL DSN are defined.
You can also activate the TRUNCATE_TABLE directive to force a truncation of the
table before data import.
.PP
The KETTLE export type is an original work by Marc Cousin.
.SS "Migration Cost Assessment"
.IX Subsection "Migration Cost Assessment"
Estimating the cost of migrating from Oracle to PostgreSQL is not easy. To
obtain a good assessment of this migration cost, Ora2Pg will inspect all database
objects, all functions and stored procedures to detect if there are any objects
and PL/SQL code that can not be automatically converted by Ora2Pg.
.PP
Ora2Pg has a content analysis mode that inspects the Oracle database to generate a
text report on what the Oracle database contains and what cannot be exported.
.PP
To activate the "analysis and report" mode, you have to use the export type
SHOW_REPORT with in the following command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-t SHOW_REPORT
.Ve
.PP
Here is a sample report obtained with this command:

.Ve
.PP
Once the database has been analysed, Ora2Pg, through its ability to convert SQL and PL/SQL
code from Oracle syntax to PostgreSQL, can go further by estimating the code complexity
and time necessary to perform a full database migration.
.PP
To estimate the migration cost in person-days, Ora2Pg allows you to use a configuration
directive called ESTIMATE_COST that you can also enable at command line:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-estimate_cost
.Ve
.PP
This feature can only be used with the SHOW_REPORT, FUNCTION, PROCEDURE, PACKAGE
and QUERY export types.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-t SHOW_REPORT  \-\-estimate_cost
.Ve

.Ve
.PP
The last line shows the total estimated migration cost in person-days following the
number of migration units estimated for each object. Each migration unit represents
approximately five minutes for a PostgreSQL expert. If this is your first migration, you can
increase it with the configuration directive COST_UNIT_VALUE or the \-\-cost_unit_value
command line option:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-t SHOW_REPORT  \-\-estimate_cost \-\-cost_unit_value 10
.Ve
.PP
Ora2Pg is also able to give you a migration difficulty level assessment. Here's a sample:
.PP
Migration level: B\-5
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    Migration levels:
\&        A \- Migration that might be run automatically
\&        B \- Migration with code rewrite and a person\-days cost up to 5 days
\&        C \- Migration with code rewrite and a person\-days cost above 5 days
\&    Technical levels:
\&        1 = trivial: no stored functions and no triggers
\&        2 = easy: no stored functions but with triggers, no manual rewriting
\&        3 = simple: stored functions and/or triggers, no manual rewriting
\&        4 = manual: no stored functions but with triggers or views with code rewriting
\&        5 = difficult: stored functions and/or triggers with code rewriting
.Ve
.PP
This assessment consists of a letter A or B to specify whether the migration needs
manual rewriting or not, and a number from 1 up to 5 to indicate a technical
difficulty level. You have an additional option \-\-human_days_limit to specify
the number of person-days limit where the migration level should be set to C
to indicate that it needs a huge amount of work and full project management
with migration support. Default is 10 person-days. You can use the configuration
directive HUMAN_DAYS_LIMIT to change this default value permanently.
.PP
This feature has been developed to help you or your boss to decide which
database to migrate first and the team that must be mobilized to conduct
the migration.
.SS "Global Oracle and MySQL migration assessment"
.IX Subsection "Global Oracle and MySQL migration assessment"
Ora2Pg comes with a script ora2pg_scanner that can be used when you have a huge
number of instances and schemas to scan for migration assessment.
.PP
Usage: ora2pg_scanner \-l CSVFILE [\-o OUTDIR]
.PP
.Vb 8
\&   \-b | \-\-binpath DIR: full path to directory where the ora2pg binary resides.
\&                Might be useful only on Windows OS.
\&   \-c | \-\-config FILE: set custom configuration file to use, otherwise ora2pg
\&                will use the default: /etc/ora2pg/ora2pg.conf.
\&   \-l | \-\-list FILE : CSV file containing a list of databases to scan with
\&                all required information. The first line of the file
\&                can contain the following header that describes the
\&                format that must be used:
\&
\&                "type","schema/database","dsn","user","password"
\&
\&   \-o | \-\-outdir DIR : (optional) by default all reports will be dumped to a
\&                directory named \*(Aqoutput\*(Aq, it will be created automatically.
\&                If you want to change the name of this directory, set the name
\&                at second argument.
\&
\&   \-t | \-\-test : just try all connections by retrieving the required schema
\&                 or database name. Useful to validate your CSV list file.
\&   \-u | \-\-unit MIN : redefine globally the migration cost unit value in minutes.
\&                 Default is taken from the ora2pg.conf (default 5 minutes).
\&
\&   Here is a full example of a CSV databases list file:
\&
\&        "type","schema/database","dsn","user","password"
\&        "MYSQL","sakila","dbi:mysql:host=192.168.1.10;database=sakila;port=3306","root","secret"
\&        "ORACLE","HR","dbi:Oracle:host=192.168.1.10;sid=XE;port=1521","system","manager"
\&        "MSSQL","HR","dbi:ODBC:driver=msodbcsql18;server=srv.database.windows.net;database=testdb","system","manager"
\&
\&   The CSV field separator must be a comma.
\&
\&   Note that if you want to scan all schemas from an Oracle instance, you just
\&   have to leave the schema field empty. Ora2Pg will automatically detect all
\&   available schemas and generate a report for each one. Of course, you need to
\&   use a connection user with enough privileges to be able to scan all schemas.
\&   For example:
\&
\&        "ORACLE","","dbi:Oracle:host=192.168.1.10;sid=XE;port=1521","system","manager"
\&        "MSSQL","","dbi:ODBC:driver=msodbcsql18;server=srv.database.windows.net;database=testdb","usrname","passwd"
\&
\&   will generate a report for all schemas in the XE instance. Note that in this
\&   case the SCHEMA directive in ora2pg.conf must not be set.
.Ve
.PP
It will generate a CSV file with the assessment result, one line per schema or
database and a detailed HTML report for each database scanned.
.PP
Hint: Use the \-t | \-\-test option beforehand to test all your connections in your
CSV file.
.PP
For Windows users, you must use the \-b command line option to set the directory
where ora2pg_scanner resides, otherwise the ora2pg command calls will fail.
.PP
In the migration assessment details about functions, Ora2Pg always includes by
default 2 migration units for TEST and 1 unit for SIZE per 1000 characters in
the code. This means that by default it will add 15 minutes to the migration
assessment per function. Obviously, if you have unit tests or very simple
functions this will not represent the actual migration time.
.SS "Migration assessment method"
.IX Subsection "Migration assessment method"
Migration unit scores given to each type of Oracle database object are defined in the
Perl library lib/Ora2Pg/PLSQL.pm in the \f(CW%OBJECT_SCORE\fR variable definition.
.PP
The number of PL/SQL lines associated with a migration unit is also defined in this file
in the \f(CW$SIZE_SCORE\fR variable value.
.PP
The number of migration units associated with each PL/SQL code difficulty can be found
in the same Perl library lib/Ora2Pg/PLSQL.pm in the hash \f(CW%UNCOVERED_SCORE\fR initialization.
.PP
This assessment method is a work in progress, so I'm expecting feedback on migration
experiences to refine the scores/units attributed in these variables.
.SS "Improving indexes and constraints creation speed"
.IX Subsection "Improving indexes and constraints creation speed"
Using the LOAD export type and a file containing SQL orders to perform, it is
possible to dispatch those orders over multiple PostgreSQL connections. To be
able to use this feature, the PG_DSN, PG_USER and PG_PWD must be set. Then:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-t LOAD \-c config/ora2pg.conf \-i schema/tables/INDEXES_table.sql \-j 4
.Ve
.PP
will dispatch index creation over 4 simultaneous PostgreSQL connections.
.PP
This will considerably accelerate this part of the migration process with huge
data sizes.
.SS "Exporting LONG RAW"
.IX Subsection "Exporting LONG RAW"
If you still have columns defined as LONG RAW, Ora2Pg will not be able to export
these kinds of data. The OCI library fails to export them and always returns the
same first record. To be able to export the data you need to transform the field
as BLOB by creating a temporary table before migrating data. For example, the
Oracle table:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&        SQL> DESC TEST_LONGRAW
\&         Name                 NULL ?   Type
\&         \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
\&         ID                            NUMBER
\&         C1                            LONG RAW
.Ve
.PP
needs to be "translated" into a table using BLOB as follows:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        CREATE TABLE test_blob (id NUMBER, c1 BLOB);
.Ve
.PP
And then copy the data with the following INSERT query:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        INSERT INTO test_blob SELECT id, to_lob(c1) FROM test_longraw;
.Ve
.PP
Then you just have to exclude the original table from the export (see EXCLUDE
directive) and to rename the new temporary table on the fly using the
REPLACE_TABLES configuration directive.
.SS "Global variables"
.IX Subsection "Global variables"
Oracle allows the use of global variables defined in packages. Ora2Pg will
export these variables for PostgreSQL as user-defined custom variables
available in a session. Oracle variable assignments are exported as
calls to:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    PERFORM set_config(\*(Aqpkgname.varname\*(Aq, value, false);
.Ve
.PP
Use of these variables in the code is replaced by:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    current_setting(\*(Aqpkgname.varname\*(Aq)::global_variables_type;
.Ve
.PP
where global_variables_type is the type of the variable extracted from
the package definition.
.PP
If the variable is a constant or has a default value assigned at
declaration, Ora2Pg will create a file global_variables.conf with
the definition to include in the postgresql.conf file so that their
values will already be set at database connection. Note that the
value can always be modified by the user so you can not have exactly
a constant.
.SS Hints
.IX Subsection "Hints"
Converting your queries with Oracle style outer join (+) syntax to ANSI standard SQL at
the Oracle side can save you a lot of time for the migration. You can use TOAD Query Builder
to re-write these using the proper ANSI syntax, see: http://www.toadworld.com/products/toad\-for\-oracle/f/10/t/9518.aspx
.PP
There's also an alternative with SQL Developer Data Modeler, see
http://www.thatjeffsmith.com/archive/2012/01/sql\-developer\-data\-modeler\-quick\-tip\-use\-oracle\-join\-syntax\-or\-ansi/
.PP
Toad is also able to rewrite the native Oracle \fBDECODE()\fR syntax into ANSI
standard SQL CASE statement. You can find some slides about this in a
presentation given at PgConf.RU: http://ora2pg.darold.net/slides/ora2pg_the_hard_way.pdf
.SS "Test the migration"
.IX Subsection "Test the migration"
The type of action called s you to check that all objects from Oracle
database have been created under PostgreSQL. Of course PG_DSN must be set to be
able to check PostgreSQL side.
.PP
Note that this feature respects the schema name limitation if EXPORT_SCHEMA and
SCHEMA or PG_SCHEMA are defined. If only EXPORT_SCHEMA is set all schemas from
Oracle and PostgreSQL are scanned. You can filter to a single schema using
SCHEMA and/or PG_SCHEMA but you can not filter on a list of schemas. To test
a list of schemas you will have to repeat the calls to Ora2Pg by specifying
a single schema each time.
.PP
For example command:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ora2pg \-t TEST \-c config/ora2pg.conf > migration_diff.txt
.Ve
.PP
Will create a file containing the report of all objects and row count on both
sides, Oracle and PostgreSQL, with an error section giving you the details of
the differences for each kind of object. Here is a sample result:

By default, Ora2Pg will extract the first 10000 rows from both sides, you can
change this value using directive DATA_VALIDATION_ROWS. When it is set to
zero all rows of the tables will be compared.
.PP
Data validation requires that the table has a primary key or unique index
and that the key column is not a LOB. Rows will be sorted using this unique
key. Due to differences in sort behavior between Oracle and PostgreSQL, if the
collation of unique key columns in PostgreSQL is not 'C', the sort order can
be different compared to Oracle. In this case the data validation will fail.
.PP
Data validation must be done before any data is modified.
.PP
Ora2Pg will stop comparing two tables after DATA_VALIDATION_ROWS is reached
or after 10 errors have been encountered, results are dumped in a file named
"data_validation.log" written in the current directory by default. The number
of errors before stopping the diff between rows can be controlled using the
configuration directive DATA_VALIDATION_ERROR. All rows with errors are printed
to the output file for your analysis.
.PP
It is possible to parallelize data validation by using \-P option or the
corresponding configuration directive PARALLEL_TABLES in ora2pg.conf.
.SS "Use of System Change Number (SCN)"
.IX Subsection "Use of System Change Number (SCN)"
Ora2Pg is able to export data as of a specific SCN. You can set it at command
line using the \-S or \-\-scn option. You can give a specific SCN or if you want
to use the current SCN at first connection time set the value to 'current'.
In this last case if connection user has the "SELECT ANY DICTIONARY" or the
"SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE" role, the current SCN is looked up in the v$database view.
.PP
Example of use:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ora2pg \-c ora2pg.conf \-t COPY \-\-scn 16605281
.Ve
.PP
This adds the following clause to the query used to retrieve data for example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    AS OF SCN 16605281
.Ve
.PP
You can also use the \-\-scn option to use the Oracle flashback capability by
specifying a timestamp expression instead of a SCN. For example:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ora2pg \-c ora2pg.conf \-t COPY \-\-scn "TO_TIMESTAMP(\*(Aq2021\-12\-01 00:00:00\*(Aq, \*(AqYYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MI:SS\*(Aq)"
.Ve
.PP
This will add the following clause to the query used to retrieve data:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    AS OF TIMESTAMP TO_TIMESTAMP(\*(Aq2021\-12\-01 00:00:00\*(Aq, \*(AqYYYY\-MM\-DD HH:MI:SS\*(Aq)
.Ve
.PP
or for example to only retrieve yesterday's data:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    ora2pg \-c ora2pg.conf \-t COPY \-\-scn "SYSDATE \- 1"
.Ve
.SS "Change Data Capture (CDC)"
.IX Subsection "Change Data Capture (CDC)"
Ora2Pg does not have a feature which allows importing data and only applying
changes after the first import. But you can use the \-\-cdc_ready option to
export data with registration of the SCN at the time of the table export.
All SCNs per table are written to a file named TABLES_SCN.log by default,
it can be changed using \-C | \-\-cdc_file option.
.PP
These SCNs registered per table during COPY or INSERT export can be used with
a CDC tool. The format of the file is tablename:SCN per line.
.SS "Importing BLOB as large objects"
.IX Subsection "Importing BLOB as large objects"
By default Ora2Pg imports Oracle BLOB as bytea, the destination column is
created using the bytea data type. If you want to use large objects instead
of bytea, just add the \-\-blob_to_lo option to the ora2pg command. It will
create the destination column as data type Oid and will save the BLOB as a
large object using the \fBlo_from_bytea()\fR function. The Oid returned by the
call to \fBlo_from_bytea()\fR is inserted in the destination column instead of
a bytea. Because of the use of the function this option can only be used
with actions SHOW_COLUMN, TABLE and INSERT. Action COPY is not allowed.
.PP
If you want to use COPY or have huge size BLOBs ( > 1GB) than cannot be
imported using \fBlo_from_bytea()\fR you can add option \-\-lo_import to the ora2pg
command. This will allow importing data in two passes.
.PP
1) Export data using COPY or INSERT will set the Oid destination column for
BLOB to value 0 and save the BLOB value into a dedicated file. It will also
create a Shell script to import the BLOB files into the database using psql
command \elo_import and to update the table Oid column to the returned large
object Oid. The script is named lo_import\-TABLENAME.sh
.PP
2) Execute all scripts lo_import\-TABLENAME.sh after setting the environment
variables PGDATABASE and optionally PGHOST, PGPORT, PGUSER, etc. if they do
not correspond to the default values for libpq.
.PP
You might also execute manually a VACUUM FULL on the table to remove the bloat
created by the table update.
.PP
Limitation: the table must have a primary key, it is used to set the WHERE
clause to update the Oid column after the large object import. Importing BLOB
using this second method (\-\-lo_import) is very slow so it should be reserved
for rows where the BLOB > 1GB. For all other rows use the option \-\-blob_to_lo.
To filter the rows you can use the WHERE configuration directive in ora2pg.conf.
